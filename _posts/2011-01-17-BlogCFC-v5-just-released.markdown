Ray Camden just released version 5 of his [BlogCFC](http://ray.camdenfamily.com/projects/blogcfc/) blog software. Ray had some new contributors this time around, and one of them is a co-worker of mine, Charlie Griefer.

I just wanted say thank you to all of the BlogCFC contributors. I use this software for my blog, and I will be upgrading my site to this version ASAP.

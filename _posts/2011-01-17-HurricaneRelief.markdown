Calvin Ward, the manager of my local ColdFusion User Group, put a very elegant [page](http://www.jaxfusion.org/gulfcoast_katrina.cfm) onto our User Group website about the disaster in the Gulf States with Hurricane Katrinna.

He has links on that page that will allow people to donate to the different NGO that are aiding in the relief effort.

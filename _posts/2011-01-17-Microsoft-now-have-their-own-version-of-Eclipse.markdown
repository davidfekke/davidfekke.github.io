Thanks to Buck Woody for bringing this to my attention, Microsoft has announced [Visual Studio Shell](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb510103.aspx). Much like Eclipse, this shell can be the basis of building tools for development. It will be interesting to see how this tool compares to Eclipse when it is released.

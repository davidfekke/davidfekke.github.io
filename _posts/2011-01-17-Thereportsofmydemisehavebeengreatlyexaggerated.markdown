I try not to talk about my job on this blog, but I heard a rumor that I was no longer working at the job I actually work at, if that makes any since. I am currently employed at a company called Recruitmax Software. I have no intention of leaving any time soon.

Just wanted to report that the rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.

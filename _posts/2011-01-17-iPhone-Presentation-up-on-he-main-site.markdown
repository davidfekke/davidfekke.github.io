I have posted my presentations from the annual Jacksonville code camp on this [site](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.presentations). Thanks to everybody who came out to code camp this weekend.

The iPhone development presentation and the ASP.NET MVC presentation are both in Microsoft Powerpoint format.

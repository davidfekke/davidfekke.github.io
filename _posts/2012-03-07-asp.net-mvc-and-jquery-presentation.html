title: ASP.NET MVC and JQuery presentation
---

<p>I wanted to thank everyone for coming out tonight and supporting the JaxDUG group. I just posted my presentation on using ASP.NET MVC with JQuery 1.7.1. All of my powerpoint presentations are up on this site at the <a href="http://www.fekke.com/powerpoint" title="Powerpoint" target="_blank">fekke.com/powerpoint</a>. The presentation I did tonight can be found at the following <a href="http://www.fekke.com/media/default/powerpoint/ASPNETMVC3JQuery.pptx" title="ASP.NET MVC 3 JQuery" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>
<p>I plan on publishing the source code up in segments when I get the time. Please let me know what you thought of the presentation if you attended tonight.</p>

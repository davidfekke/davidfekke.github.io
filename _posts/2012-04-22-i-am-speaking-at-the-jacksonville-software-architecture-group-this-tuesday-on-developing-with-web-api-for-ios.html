<p>I am speaking at the Jacksonville Software Architecture Group this Tuesday, April 24th on how to leverage the new Web API for building services that can be consumed on mobile devices. Microsoft's new Web API makes it very easy to develop light weight rest based web services that can be consumed on any platform.</p>
<p>My presentation on Tuesday will demo how to develop services very quickly using the Web API. I will also be demoing how to consume those services in an iPhone app.</p>
<p>The meeting starts at 6:00 PM, April 24th at building 500 on the Bank of America campus off Southside Blvd.</p>

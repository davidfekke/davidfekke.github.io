title: Azure Websites
---

<p>Scott Guthrie's last blog <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/09/17/announcing-great-improvements-to-windows-azure-web-sites.aspx" title="Azure post" target="_blank">post</a> had details on Microsoft's new Azure websites. Some of the big improvements are a new shared tier hosting, A-Record support and Fast-CGI support.</p>
<p>One of the features I like is GitHub and CodePlex continuous integration support. He has some demonstrations on how you can push changes into your repository and they automatically get loaded onto the website.</p>
<p>I have avoided using Azure in the past because of price and a-record support, but now with the new pricing structure I will probably use Azure going forward for small sites.</p>
<p>Azure also supports PHP and Node.js applications. They even host Linux VMs if you need a Linux VM.</p>

Thanks to everyone who came out to my presentation at Code Camp on Objective-C for .NET developers. I have added that [presentation](http://fekke.com/Media/Default/powerpoint/Objective-CforCSharpDevelopers.ppt "Objective-C Presentation") to my powerpoint page on this site. All of my powerpoint slides can be found at [http://fekke.com/powerpoint](http://fekke.com/powerpoint "Powerpoint"). I hope to see everyone who came out today at this months [JaxMUG](jaxmug.com "jaxmug") meeting.

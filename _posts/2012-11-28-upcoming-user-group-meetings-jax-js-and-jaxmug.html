This is an app I wrote and published in the Apple App store. I will show the code that comprises the business logic, which is C# but is compiled on a Mac using MonoTouch. This process converts it to Objective-C. I will also demonstrate Apple's Xcode and Interface Builder and how they interact with MonoTouch. I will talk about some of the steps necessary to get your apps into the app store.&nbsp;<br /><br />BIO:&nbsp;<br /><br />Irv Adams holds a BA degree in Mathematics.

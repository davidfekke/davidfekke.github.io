Orchard 0.8 Released,Orchard-08-Released,"<p>The <a href=""http://www.orchardproject.net/"" target=""_blank"">Orchard CMS</a> version 0.8 has been released. This release has a new theme engine written using the new Razor rendering views. Orchard is based on ASP.NET MVC. Here is the write up from announcement on the release;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">The Orchard Project team is pleased to announce the availability of  the Orchard 0.8 release, which provides essential features that  designers need to tailor the look-and-feel of Orchard sites. The release  can be downloaded from <a href=""http://www.orchardproject.net/download"">http://www.orchardproject.net/download</a> The  Orchard 0.8 release includes a theme engine based on the new Razor  syntax in ASP.NET MVC, which is an extensible object model for defining  &ldquo;shapes&rdquo;, as well as a flexible template system for rendering those  shapes. The theme engine includes support for multiple layouts and  zones, a script and style sheet registration API, and more. It also  includes a new default theme, &ldquo;The Theme Machine&rdquo;, which leverages these  features and can be adapted to fit the needs of different site designs.<br /><br />As  if a Theme Machine isn&rsquo;t cool enough, the 0.8 release also includes  support for widgets - in this case, configurable UI elements, such as a  tag cloud or search input, which can be easily mapped to different  regions in the site (for example, a sidebar). The configuration of  individual widgets and the rules about where they appear in the site are  configurable from the Orchard admin panel.<br /><br />For designers, this  offers the flexibility to either brand individual sites or create  reusable themes to be shared with others. Orchard 0.8 also includes  support for packaging themes and publishing them to an online gallery  feed where other users can discover and download them.</p>
<p>I will be giving a presentation on Orchard at the <a href=""http://www.jaxdug.com/"" target=""_blank"">JaxDUG</a> next Wednesday.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:14.000,markdown
ASP.NET MVC 3 Beta is Out unless You Use Windows XP,ASPNET-MVC-3-Beta-is-Out-unless-You-Use-WIndows-XP,"<p>I was reading Scott Guthrie's blog <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/10/06/announcing-nupack-asp-net-mvc-3-beta-and-webmatrix-beta-2.aspx"" target=""_blank"">post</a> about the just released ASP.NET MVC 3 Beta. So I decided to download the bits, and get MVC running on my Windows XP box only to find out that it will not run due to a dependency on the ASP.NET Web Pages. MVC 3 preview did run on Windows XP.</p>
<p>I know Microsoft no longer wants to support OSs older than Vista, but unfortuneatly the version of an OS that a developer uses is determined by their IT department. I spoke to a Microsoft Developer evangelist about not supporting Windows XP for upcoming developer tools, and he told me I should take that up with my IT department.</p>
<p>Many large companies skipped Windows Vista, opting to continue to use XP. Even though Windows 7 has been more widely accepted, it has been out for less than a year. Many companies will not deploy a new version of Windows until Service Pack 1 has been released. This has left many developers in a black hole, where they cannot upgrade their tools due to policies set by their companies.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:14.000,markdown

Whose Fault are the iPhone 4 Reception issues;  Answer: The Government,Whose-Fault-are-the-iPhone-4-Reception-issues-Answer-The-Government,"<p>Full disclosure here, I own an iPhone 4. I also develop software for the iPhone, so I have a vested interest in the iPhone succeeding as a platform. I have seen where you can drop the radio reception of the phone when you press on the lower left hand corner. Any phone you where you hold your hand on the antenna will reduce the reception. Between my previous iPhone 3Gs and my new iPhone 4 I have not been able to see a difference in call quality or data performance. If anything, the iPhone 4 seems like it may be a little better.</p>
<p>The office where I work is in downtown Jacksonville, FL. The AT&amp;T coverage is horrible here, but my iPhone seems to have a better time making phone calls than my 3Gs.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs had a <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/16/live-from-apples-iphone-4-press-conference/"">press conference</a> today to discuss the iPhone 4 reception issues. A lot of blame has been placed on Apple for their antenna design, but the iPhone in the United States has always had reception issues and dropped calls. In the past much of the blame has been put on AT&amp;T, but even then there are only certain areas that have bad reception. San Francisco and New York are always mentioned.</p>
<p>So whose fault are the reception issues. The Answer is the Government. In particular, local and state governments. One of the key take aways from that press conference was the amount of time it takes to add a cell tower. Here is an excerpt from the press conference today;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>When AT&amp;T wants to add a cell tower in Texas, it takes about three  weeks... w<strong>hen they want to add one in San Francisco, it takes three years</strong>. That's  the single biggest problem they're having. They're spending a lot  expanding their networks, and our data rates are way better on the  iPhone 4, but AT&amp;T has to expand its network, and that's a long  process. I know because we're constantly asking about it. They're trying  really hard, and sometimes I think they should enlist the support of  the users in the community.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>-</em>Steve Jobs</p>
<p>The reason it takes three years to add a new cell tower in San Francisco is the amount of government required red tape you have to go through to add a new tower. Steve Jobs is hardly an anti-government Tea Party Republican. I don't believe he would have brought it up at the press conference unless the government red tape was really creating problems resolving network issues.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T should enlist their customers to call and right their local representatives to remove the red tape for adding new cell towers.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:14.000,markdown

Xcode 4 was previewed at WWDC, Apple's developer conference earlier this month. I have been developing applications in Xcode for a little over year, and it looks like it fixes a lot of the complaints that I and other developers have had about xcode 3 who have used Visual Studio.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes is that Interface Builder is no longer a separate application, it is built into Xcode. Another one of that changes is that there is a single window for the whole IDE. You can open up your header file and implementation file at the same time.</p>
<p>I know this will make the Ruby developers happy, Xcode 4 supports git. Apple is also adding a timeline viewer so you can use a time machine like slider to look at you code changes as well as side by side comparisons of the different versions of the file.</p>
<p>I am very excited about this release of Xcode.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:15.000,markdown

Steve Jobs blogs about Flash,Steve-Jobs-blogs-about-Flash,"<p>Steve Jobs does not have a blog, but he does have a website called Apple.com. He has posted his thoughts on Flash at the following URL:</p>
<p><a title=""Thoughts on Flash"" href=""http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/</a></p>
<p>There has been some controversy on Apple not having a way of playing back Flash content on their mobile devices. I think the main reason is that the mobile devices have slower processors, and Flash would slow the device down. Other than JavaScript, Apple does not allow interpreted environments to run on top of their hardware. Flash like Java has a VM that it runs on top of, and Apple does not allow emulation.</p>
<p>I have written Flex/Flash based applications, and one of the things I like about Flash is that you can write applications that look and act the same on any platform. This does not necessary translate well to mobile devices. I think you are better off writting software for the platform for mobile devices. I have written iPhone applications using Objective-C. I know a lot of Actionscript developers are probably weary of learning a new language, but Objective-C is not that big of a transition.</p>
<p>Jobs mentioned that he thought that HTML5 makes Flash obsolete, but HTML5 even though it is an open standard, the MP4 video format is a proprietary. HTML5 is still an unfinished spec. I think it shows great promise, but the browser vendors will interpret the spec different ways. The nice thing about Flas is that it always looks and acts the same on different platforms.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:15.000,markdown

How not to Protest 101,How-not-to-Protest-101,"<p>Last week in Califiornia, and in other parts of the country students protested tuition hikes and budget cuts in their colleges and universities. In California where the state has a $20 billion budget shortfall, the students there protested by <a href=""http://www.kcra.com/education/22738602/detail.html"" target=""_blank"">holding up traffic</a>.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in the First amendment, and for the rights of Americans to peaceably assemble. One of the goals of a protest is to sway people to your point of view. Holding up traffic does not achieve this goal. It turns people against you and your argument.</p>
<p>Traffic in California is already pretty bad. Running out into traffic on Interstate 80 just makes it much worse, and will turn the public against you and your argument. There are much more affective ways of protesting. Holding up traffic just makes the public think you are a narcissistic brat.</p>
<p>I would suggest actually looking at the state and school budgets, and making suggestions to you local state representives on how your tax dollars should be spent.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:15.000,markdown

Why Internet Explorer 6 will not Die,Why-Internet-Explorer-6-will-not-Die,"<p>There have been a lot of posts on the interwebs this Summer on supporting Internet Explorer 6 (IE6). Recently on the Digg blog there was a <a href=""http://blog.digg.com/?p=878"" target=""_blank"">post</a> from one of the engineers that they have very low usage from IE6 at this point, so they are dropping support.</p><p>
</p><p>
Ina Fried also had a <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10309072-56.html?tag=mncol"" target=""_blank"">post</a> on how Microsoft is having a hard time getting companies to upgrade to newer version of IE. I am currently building web applications for business users, and as much as I would like to stop supporting IE6 it still has a 40 percent market share in the financial sector.</p><p>
</p><p>
A lot of the problem stems from the fact that most companies are deploying desktops with Windows XP and IE6. IE6 was released in 2001, and has really started to show its age. Some of the problems have been that it does not support W3C standards fully, poor CSS support, security bugs as well as Javascript interpreter bugs.</p><p>
</p><p>
Even though IE7 and IE8 have improved on the standards and security, there are still major problems with the Javascript bugs.</p><p>
</p><p>
Hopefully with Windows 7 coming out soon, more companies will start to upgrade their PCs with this new operating system.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:17.000,markdown

iPhone Development First Observations,iPhone-Development-First-Observations,"<p><p>I recently started developing some iPhone applications and registered in the iPhone SDK program at Apple. As Apple typically does, they have sworn me to secrecy about their new iPhone APIs.  It has been fun planing around with Apple's development tools. If you use a Mac, the development tools are are free. On the Mac there are already a lot of options for developing application. I have used the Mac for years for doing my ColdFusion, Flex/Air and Java server development. Up until a couple of months ago I have never bothered to actually use Apple's tools such as xcode and Interface builder. Xcode will allow you to build applications using many different languages including AppleScript, Ruby, Python, Java and C++.  The iPhone is a different animal. You can only develop using Objective C or C++. By default Objective C is Apple's language of choice. One of the key reasons Apple has given for this limited choice are the limited resources of the iPhone. As advanced as the iPhone is, it is using an Arm processor with 128 MB of RAM.  On the Mac you can use a garbage collector when developing Obj-C applications, but this is not an option on the iPhone. You are required to do your own memory management. Obj-C uses pointers for non-primitive objects, but Apple has actually implemented a nice framework that helps you manage your memory.  Obj-C, like C++ uses header files. Your header files typically contain your interface, while you code file contains the implementation. This is one of the things that has kept me from ever doing any C++ development. I always have felt writing a header file is like having to write the same code twice.  So far I am finding Objective C to be a language that is somewhere in between C++ and Java in its ease of use. Another thing that C developers will find weird is the SmallTalk like syntax. A typical call to create a new object might look like the following example;</p></p><p>
<p>[code:c#]</p></p><p>
<p>NSObject *myObject = [[NSObject alloc] init];</p></p><p>
<p>[/code]</p></p><p>
<p>The same call in Java would look like this;</p></p><p>
<p>[code:c#]</p></p><p>
<p>[code:c#]NSObject myObject = new NSObject(); [/code]></p></p><p>
<p>[code:c#][/code][/code]></p></p><p>

Twitter from the command line in Mac OS X 10.5,Twitter-from-the-command-line-in-Mac-OS-X-105,"<p>I am a big fan of public APIs that are provided by web sites such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook. I think one of the reasons that twitter has been successful is that their service can be accessed through their <a href=""http://apiwiki.twitter.com/"" target=""_blank"">API's</a>.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the jokes I heard at the Miami Flex Camp was that <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/air/"" target=""_blank"">Adobe Air</a> was a framework for building twitter applications. The truth is that Air is simply taking advantage of the public API's.</p><p>
</p><p>
Here is a Shell script that I wrote to send twitter updates from the BASH shell in Mac OS X 10.5;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
#!/bin/bash</p><p>
curl -u username:password -d status=""$1"" http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml</p><p>
echo ""Sent twitter a status update""</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
You will need to replace the username and password with your own username and password. I named my script ""twitter"". Once you create the script, you will need to change the permissions on the file to execute using a command like the following;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
sudo chmod +x twitter</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
Once you have set the permissions on the file, you can use it in the following way;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
./twitter ""I am updating my twitter status""</p><p>
[/code]> </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:18.000,markdown

Running SVN 1.5 on Mac OS X 10.5 with Apache 2.2,Running-SVN-15-on-Mac-OS-X-105-with-Apache-22,"<p>I use subversion at work, but I have been wanting to run a subversion server at home. On Windows I use Visual SVN server, but at home I am running Mac OS X on all of my home computers. I use one of my Macs as a server.</p><p>
</p><p>
Here is the good news. Mac OS X 10.5 comes with Apache 2.2 and SVN pre-installed. </p><p>
</p><p>
Here is the bad news. An older version of SVN exists on Mac OS X. I believe it is version 1.4.4 of subversion.</p><p>
</p><p>
I found some good resources on how to set up Subversion with Apache 2.2. This <a href=""http://www.sonzea.com/articles/subversion-trac.html"" target=""_blank"">Sonzea</a> article does a good job of the nuts and bolts of setting up a SVN repository. I did have to change the chmod to ""www"" instead of ""_www"". I was not able to get trac working. I think it was because I am using an older Mac with a PowerPC processor.</p><p>
</p><p>
I also was able to install a <a href=""http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/community/"" target=""_blank"">newer version</a> of subversion software from the Collab.net site. After the newer version of subversion is installed, I had to change my subversion.conf file so that it pointed to the newer shared objects.</p><p>
</p><p>
By default you point your subversion.conf file to the following location;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
LoadModule dav_svn_module     libexec/apache2/mod_dav_svn.so</p><p>
LoadModule authz_svn_module   libexec/apache2/mod_authz_svn.so</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
After I installed the newer version of SVN, I changed this file to point to the new location of the mod_dav_svn.so and mod_authz_svn.so files.</p><p>
</p><p>

JQuery :empty vs :blank filters,JQuery-empty-vs-blank-filters,"<p>I ran into an issue this morning using a JQuery selector filter. One of the things I like about JQuery is that they have some pretty cool filters that you can use to specify different parts of your DOM. </p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
jQuery(""table tr:first""); // This will select the first row.</p><p>
</p><p>
jQuery(""table tr:last""); // this will select the last row.</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
I was trying to select all cells that were blank or empty so I used the following;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
$(""#myIDName td:blank""); //Find all <td></td> in table.</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
This worked fine in Firefox, but created all kinds of Havoc. I do not believe this is officially supported by the JQuery group.</p><p>
</p><p>
I was able to solve the problem using the following change to my selector.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
$(""#myIDName td:empty"");</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
I am assuming that blank has been deprecated or was never fully supported, either way you should just use the :empty filter. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:19.000,markdown

Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Rays,Congratulations-to-the-Tampa-Bay-Rays,"<p><img src=""http://www.fekke.com/blog/images/RaysWinPennant2008.jpg"" /></p><p>
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Rays on their ALCS pennant win yesterday. I have been a fan of the Rays since their inaugural season in 1998. After nine seasons of being in the baseball basement, all I have to say is this feels good.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have a number of friends who live in Boston who I know are not feeling well this morning about their Red Sox. The first baseball game I ever saw was in Fenway Park, and I rooted for Boston over the Yankees in 2004 when Boston came back from being three games down to beat the Yanks. The Red Sox are a great team, but this was not to be their year, it is Tampa's.</p><p>
</p><p>
At the beginning of the season, the Tampa Bay Rays were 200/1 to win the World Series. It has been one wild ride this year. Joe Maddon deserves a ton of credit for turning the Rays around, along with the new ownership. </p><p>
</p><p>
After listening to the Bob Costas' of the world bad mouth my home team for the last ten years, it is nice to see them host the 2008 World Series in my home town of Tampa. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:20.000,markdown

My MyGig system has a 20 gigabyte hard drive. After the update it reset all of my phone numbers, and my paired phones. Chrysler does warn that stored numbers will be lost. I re-paired my iPhone 3G with the MyGig's bluetooth. Other than the issues with the phone, the upgrade was flawless. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:21.000,markdown

Oracle 10g error: OCIEnvCreate failed with return code -1,Oracle-10g-error-OCIEnvCreate-failed-with-return-code-1,"<p>I have run into this error recently ""OCIEnvCreate failed with return code -1 "" trying to make a database connection to Oracle from a .NET 2.0 application. It took me a couple of days to resolve the error, but it stems from having to have ODP.NET and another Oracle client installed on the same machine as my application. Running into this error really made me appreciate JDBC for making connections to Oracle, which has always been relatively simple.</p><p>
</p><p>
The mistake I made was just trying to install just ODP.NET for Oracle 10.2.0.21 on the client machine. The OCIEnvCreate failed message went away after I installed the Oracle production client 10.2.0.3 on my client machine. The end result is that you have to have two different sets of client software installed in order to be able to make a connection to Oracle 10g.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:22.000,markdown

No iPhone 3G for you,No-iPhone-3G-for-you,"<p>So I went to buy a new iPhone 3G on friday. After standing in line for two hours I was not able to buy an iPhone 3G. After getting to the front of the line I was told there was an error in my AT&T account that would prevent me from upgrading. Apparently some AT&T accounts were preventing users from upgrading to the new phone because of family account or business reference. In my case it was a business reference. Apple would not let me walk out of the store with one of the new phones. So I called AT&T on Saturday and tried to speak to a customer service representative who could help. After being transferred and hung up on about six times, I was able to speak to someone who handles business accounts, even though I do not have a business account. I was told I needed to speak to someone in premier support, the business account department was able help me figure out what was wrong.</p><p>
</p><p>
It turns out that AT&T had thousands of customers who had errors in their database accounts that prevented them from upgrading. In the Apple stores, the account would show up with an ""IRU not supported"" error. If you got this error, you could not buy an iPhone.</p><p>
</p><p>
So after I went back to the Apple store after the error had been fixed on AT&Ts side, I still got the ""IRU not supported"" error when I tried to buy the iPhone. I spoke to an AT&T representative again, and was told that it takes 24 hours for the records to get sent down to Apple's system.</p><p>
</p><p>
So I went back to Apple store on Sunday, and all iPhones are sold out now. No Apple or AT&T store in Jacksonville has iPhones in stock anymore.</p><p>
</p><p>
So now I am on waiting list for an iPhone 3G. All of this because Apple and AT&T require in store activations. If they did not have this requirement, I could have walked out of the store with an iPhone 3G on Friday.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:22.000,markdown

</p><p>
I saw Carlin the first time I was out in Vegas. At the end of his routine he did his famous bit on ""the"" Seven dirty words you can't say on radio or TV. He said when he originally did the bit, it was not ""the"" seven words, it was ""here are seven words you can't say"". </p><p>
</p><p>
A radio station played the bit late at night in 1978, and they were fined by the FCC. They took their case all the the way to the Supreme Court until the court said that you cannot actually say those seven words.</p><p>
</p><p>
Carlin said that he was proud because his name was mentioned in the annals of the Supreme Court for all eternity. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:22.000,markdown
Enterprise Library Oracle and SQL Server Parameter Tokens,Enterprise-Library-Oracle-and-SQL-Server-Parameter-Tokens,"<p>I have been using the DAAB part of the Enterprise Library at my current job. One of the advantages of using this library is that you can write ANSI standard SQL, and it should work with any Relational Database.</p><p>
</p><p>
The problem with this is that if you want to use parametrized queries, T-SQL and PL-SQL use different prefixes in front of the parameters. SQL Server uses '@' symbols in front of the parameter names, and Oracle uses ':' in front of their parameters. So how can you write Ad hoc queries that will run on both SQL Server and Oracle. I have written a class that will set the parameter tokens automatically based on your database context.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
using System;</p><p>
using System.Collections.Generic;</p><p>
using System.Linq;</p><p>
using System.Text;</p><p>
using Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Data; </p><p>
</p><p>
namespace MyDataAccessNamespace</p><p>
{</p><p>
    public class DAABDbTokenSetter</p><p>
    {</p><p>
        public static string CreateParam(Database db, string parameterName)</p><p>
        {</p><p>
            string TokenPrefix = """";</p><p>
            string DatabaseType = db.DbProviderFactory.ToString();</p><p>
            if (DatabaseType == ""System.Data.SqlClient.SqlClientFactory"")</p><p>
            {</p><p>
                TokenPrefix = ""@"";</p><p>
            }</p><p>
            else if (DatabaseType == ""System.Data.OracleClient.OracleClientFactory"")</p><p>
            {</p><p>
                TokenPrefix = "":"";</p><p>

        }</p><p>
    }</p><p>
}</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
This class can be used in your ad hoc queries in the following way to set the tokens;</p><p>

string myquery = ""select firstname, lastname "" +</p><p>
   ""from customertable "" + </p><p>

WCF versus traditional ASMX web services,WCF-versus-traditional-ASMX-web-services,"<p>I just purchased a book on the Windows Communication Foundation. I had a discussion with a Co-worker about why someone would write a SOAP based web service in WCF over traditional ASMX. One of the advantages of WCF is that you take a service written in WCF, and also use it as a MSMQ messaging service or a windows service. I think there is a perception that if you write your services in WCF, they will not be compatible with Java, ColdFusion and other technologies. WCF is completely backwards compatible with the SOAP specification.</p><p>
</p><p>
Microsoft suggests that if you are writing new web services in .NET, you should write them using in WCF.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:23.000,markdown

Getting just the XML retruned from a Web Service,Getting-just-the-XML-retruned-from-a-Web-Service,"<p>I got a question yesterday about how to just get the XML being returned from a web service call. SOAP Based web services use a XML standard syntax when the client communicates with a service. ColdFusion does a pretty good job of translating the return value into either a simple object, or a Java like serialized object.</p><p>
</p><p>
I believe CF7 included some new functions for returning the XML used in the request and the response. Here is an example below;</p><p>

    ws = CreateObject(""webservice"",</p><p>

Converting WMF files to Gif files in ColdFusion 8 using the .NET interop,Converting-WMF-files-to-Gif-files-in-ColdFusion-8-using-the-NET-interop,"<p>Todd over at cfsilence.com had a a question about one of my recent blog posts on converting WMF files to GIF files. I gave an example of how to do this in .NET, but how do you leverage ColdFusion's .NET integration to do the same thing in ColdFusion.</p><p>
</p><p>
The first thing you have to do is create a class project in .NET. Add a reference to the System.Drawing library. Here is the class I built for this example; [code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
using System;</p><p>
using System.Collections.Generic;</p><p>
using System.Drawing;</p><p>
using System.Drawing.Imaging;</p><p>
using System.IO;</p><p>
using System.Text;</p><p>
</p><p>
namespace ImageConvertLibrary</p><p>
{</p><p>
    public class GifItUtility</p><p>
    {</p><p>
        public static void saveGifToPath(string wmfFilePath, string gifFilePath)</p><p>
        {</p><p>
            </p><p>
            Image myImage = Image.FromFile(wmfFilePath, true);</p><p>
            int myWidth = (int)myImage.HorizontalResolution;</p><p>
            int myHeight = (int)myImage.VerticalResolution;</p><p>
            Bitmap myBitmap = new Bitmap(myImage, (int)myImage.HorizontalResolution, (int)myImage.VerticalResolution); </p><p>
            Graphics myGraphics = Graphics.FromImage(myBitmap);</p><p>
            myGraphics.Clear(Color.White);</p><p>
            myGraphics.DrawImage(myImage, 0, 0, myWidth, myHeight);</p><p>
            </p><p>
            myBitmap.Save(gifFilePath, ImageFormat.Gif);</p><p>
            </p><p>
        }</p><p>
    }</p><p>
}</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
Build the project into a dll file that can be added to the Windows assembly. Visual Studio will place this file either in the project bin/debug or bin/release folder. </p><p>
</p><p>
The saveGifToPath method excepts two string parameters, one for the input WMF file path, and the second for the path to GIF file.</p><p>
</p><p>
Here is an example of a ColdFusion file using this class and method to create a GIF file from a WMF file;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
<cfset myImageConvertObject = createObject("".NET"",""ImageConvertLibrary.GifItUtility"", ""C:\Users\dfekke\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\ImageConvertLibrary\ImageConvertLibrary\bin\Release\ImageConvertLibrary.dll"") /></p><p>
</p><p>
<cfset wmfFile = ""C:\metafile.wmf"" /></p><p>
<cfset gifFile = ""C:\rasterfile.gif"" /></p><p>
</p><p>
<cfset myImageConvertObject.saveGifToPath(wmfFile, gifFile) /></p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
I did some googling for a Java library that will do the same thing as this .NET code, and I found some propriatery libraries that will do converting of images from the WMF format. If you are running ColdFusion on Windows, or you have a Windows server you can proxy too, this is a free way to convert this files.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:25.000,markdown
Converting Image files in InfoPath to gifs once submitted,Converting-Image-files-in-InfoPath-to-gifs-once-submitted,"<p>I have been developing a lot of windows workflows and web services in .NET recently. I came across a need to convert a WMF file (Windows Meta File) into a gif file. SQL Server Reporting Services can not display WMF files.</p><p>
</p><p>
.NET 2.0 can convert and resize images natively. Here is how I converted the WMF files. First I added the following using statements;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
using System.Drawing;</p><p>
using System.Drawing.Imaging;</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
InfoPath saves images as Base64 strings, and .NET treats this as a byte array. So I had to convert the WMF byte array to a gif byte array.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
byte[] imageByteArray = DiagramImage;</p><p>
MemoryStream inStream = new MemoryStream(imageByteArray);</p><p>
StreamReader myStreamReader = new StreamReader(inStream);</p><p>
Image myImage = Image.FromStream(inStream);</p><p>
Bitmap myBitmap = new Bitmap(myImage);</p><p>
Graphics myGraphics = Graphics.FromImage(myBitmap);</p><p>
//Keep background white.</p><p>
myGraphics.Clear(Color.White);</p><p>
myGraphics.DrawImage(myImage, 0, 0, myImage.Width, myImage.Height);</p><p>
MemoryStream outStream = new MemoryStream();</p><p>
myBitmap.Save(outStream, ImageFormat.Gif);</p><p>
byte[] gifByteArray = outStream.GetBuffer();</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]> </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:25.000,markdown
Microsoft Yahoo Hostile Takeover,Microsoft-Yahoo-Hostile-Takeover,"<p>Yahoo's board of directors rejected Microsoft's offer to buy Yahoo this weekend. I have been thinking about the Microsoft Yahoo takeover proposition. It reminds me of Time Warner AOL merger. There are a lot of reasons why the AOL Time Warner merger failed. The one reason that sticks in mind was the cultural differences between AOL and Time Warner. The cultures of the two companies clashed. Never mind the fact that AOL's business model was based on dialup internet access and a walled garden of content.</p><p>
</p><p>
Microsoft and Yahoo would have similar culture problems if they merged. Microsoft eats its own dog food when it comes to consuming technology. Microsoft, for the most part, uses Windows Server, SQL Server, .NET and IIS. Yahoo uses a lot of open source technology including Apache, Linux and PHP. They also use a lot of Adobe software as well. The developers who develop for open source technologies, don't like Microsoft, and they do not want to work with Microsoft.</p><p>
If Microsoft were to buy Yahoo, they would not keep any of Yahoo's infrastructure. They would rip it out in favor of Microsoft technology. All of Yahoo's PHP apps would be rewritten in .NET, Linux would be replaced with Windows, and Apache would be replaced with IIS.</p><p>
</p><p>
Microsoft's attraction to Yahoo has to largely with Ad revenue. Ironically, this is one of the things that attracted Time Warner to AOL.</p><p>
</p><p>
For full disclosure, my current employer is a Gold Partner with Microsoft. I am also a stockholder in a company that does business with Yahoo. At my current company, we have a pretty good working relationship with Microsoft. I think Microsoft should consider partnering in certain areas with Yahoo, but a full merger is a bad idea. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:25.000,markdown
Carlos Costa and The Shoot Down,Carlos-Costa-and-The-Shoot-Down,"<p><img src=""http://www.fekke.com/blog/images/carloscosta.jpg"" align=""left""> I went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University from 1988 to 1992. While there I had the opportunity to meet Carlos Costa. Carlos was in the same program I was in which is the Aeronautical Science program where students learn how to become professional pilots.</p><p>
</p><p>
Carlos went on to fly with Brothers to the Rescue. Brothers to the Rescue flew over the Florida straights in Cessna Skymasters between Florida and Cuban airspace looking for Cuban refugees trying to escape from Cuba. On February 24th, 1996 the Cuban government sent Migs to shoot down Brothers to the Rescue. Carlos and another Embry-Riddle student, Mario De La Peña, where killed while flying in international airspace.</p><p>

Sending Email with Attachments from Sharepoint Custom Workflows,Sending-Email-with-Attachments-from-Sharepoint-Custom-Workflows,"<p>I have been developing custom Sharepoint workflows in Visual Studio 2005 over the past year. It can be fustrating developing for Sharepoint 2007 because Microsoft has done a lousy job documenting the Sharepoint API.</p><p>
</p><p>
The SendMail activity in the workflow tools does not allow for email attachments. I found a good work around is to use the .NET email API in a custom code activity. In the following example I send an email with an attachment.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient();</p><p>
client.Host = smtpServer;</p><p>
client.Port = 25;</p><p>
client.DeliveryMethod = SmtpDeliveryMethod.Network;</p><p>
</p><p>
MailMessage myMailMessage = new MailMessage();</p><p>
myMailMessage.From = new MailAddress(this.fromEmail);</p><p>
myMailMessage.Subject = ""Test email subject"";</p><p>
myMailMessage.Body = ""This is a test email message."";</p><p>
myMailMessage.To.Add(new MailAddress(toEmail));</p><p>
</p><p>
MemoryStream myMemoryStream = new MemoryStream(this.attachmentByteArray);</p><p>
myMailMessage.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(myMemoryStream, this.attachmentFileName));</p><p>
                    </p><p>
client.Send(myMailMessage);</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
If you need to dynamically get the name of the Smtp server, you can get this throught the parent web application. Here is an example of how to call it through the Workflow Properties.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
SPSite site = this.workflowProperties.Site;</p><p>
            </p><p>
SPWebApplication webapp = site.WebApplication;</p><p>
//Get the SMTP server </p><p>
string smtpServer = webapp.OutboundMailServiceInstance.Server.Address;</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
I found the previous example in this  </p><p>
<a href=""http://blog.bacchin.org/2007/08/sharepoint-2007-outgoing-smtp-server.html"" target=""_blank"">Blog post</a>.</p><p>
</p><p>
Update</p><p>
</p><p>
There is a question on how I got the Byte[] array. I used a InfoPath form to collect the attachment. The InfoPath form stores this attachment in a XML node as base64 encoded string. When .NET pulls the value from the XML node, it turns the value into a byte array. I then use the following code to extract the filename and the document data;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
byte[] myAttachment = myInfoPathForm.Attachment;</p><p>
                </p><p>
if (myAttachment != null)</p><p>
{</p><p>
   int namebufferlen = myAttachment[20] * 2;</p><p>
   byte[] filenameBuffer = new byte[namebufferlen];</p><p>
   for (int i = 0; i < filenameBuffer.Length; i++)</p><p>
   {</p><p>
      filenameBuffer[i] = myAttachment[24 + i];</p><p>
   }</p><p>
   char[] asciiChars = UnicodeEncoding.Unicode.GetChars(filenameBuffer);</p><p>
   string filename = new string(asciiChars);</p><p>
   filename = filename.Substring(0, filename.Length - 1);</p><p>
</p><p>
   byte[] filecontent = new byte[myAttachment.Length - (24 + namebufferlen)];</p><p>
   for (int i = 0; i < filecontent.Length; i++)</p><p>
   {</p><p>
      filecontent[i] = myAttachment[24 + namebufferlen + i];</p><p>
   }</p><p>
</p><p>
   this.attachmentByte = filecontent;</p><p>
   this.attachmentFileName = filename;</p><p>
}</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
This code only works if you are pulling the data from an InfoPath form.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:25.000,markdown

HD-DVD is Dead to Me,HDDVD-is-Dead-to-Me,"<p>I am a big fan of open standards. One of the things that has prevented me from upgrading to a HDTV and a new high def player is that lack of a high def format standard.</p><p>
</p><p>
There have been two camps for the last couple of years for high def video players, Toshiba's HD-DVD and Sony's Blu-Ray. This past weekend Warner Brothers anounced that they were going drop support for HD-DVD and go with Blu-Ray exclusively. I read today on <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/07/paramount-following-warner-out-the-hd-dvd-door/"" target=""_blank"">engadget</a> that Paramount was switching to Blu-Ray. That leaves only one major studio behind HD-DVD, that being Universal, and I am sure Universal will drop support as well.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have not purchased one of these players yet because I did not want to get <i>Betamaxed</i>. I will probably buy a Blu-Ray player now, I am even thinking about getting a Play Station 3. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:25.000,markdown

Java on Mac OS X: The Silence is deafening,Java-on-Mac-OS-X-The-Silence-is-deafening,"<p>My software update feature on my older Mac showed that I had downloaded Java release 6 for Mac OS X 10.4. I got really exited until I read the release notes;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
This release of Java for Mac OS X includes improvements for Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5.0 (J2SE 5.0) and Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 1.4.2 (Java 1.4.2) on Mac OS X. It features Apple's implementation of Sun's J2SE Versions 1.5.0_13 and 1.4.2_16.</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
It looks like this is a series of security updates. Before Leopard was released Apple had a prerelease version of Java SE 6 on their developer site, which they took down earlier in the year. I had hoped that Apple would release Java SE 6 with Mac OS 10.5, but I was let down when it was released to find it only had Java SE 5.</p><p>
</p><p>
Apple is known for its secrecy when it comes to releasing new products. I can understand that when it comes to certain products and software. The problem comes when you are trying to develop for a platform. Developers have to have SDKs, APIs and the other tools so they can start to develop for the platform before it is released.</p><p>
</p><p>
Right now the silence coming from Cupertino is deafening. Apple should come out and say if they are going to continue to develop Java on the Mac so developers can start planning what technology they need to use in their future products.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have liked Java because I could write applications that can run on any platform, whether it was Linux, Mac or Windows. If Apple is not going to develop Java on the Mac anymore, Sun needs to start developing future versions for the Mac like they do for Windows.</p><p>

Sharepoint 2007 Custom Workflow Initiation form Gotcha,Sharepoint-2007-Custom-Workflow-Initiation-form-Gotcha,"<p>I recently came across a nasty bug in Sharepoint 2007. When a custom workflow uses an intiation form to collect data for the start of a workflow, it will only collect this form when the workflow is run manually.</p><p>
</p><p>
Workflow intiation forms can be created using InfoPath or aspx pages to collect data that can be used in the workflowProperties.InitiationData property. This form is only presented to the user when the workflow is run manualy in Sharepoint 2007. If you set the workflow to start automatically when an item is created or changed, Sharepoint will not present this form to collect the InitiationData.</p><p>
</p><p>
There are a couple of work arounds you can use to get around this bug. One is you can set the InitiationData using an Association form when the workflow is first added to the Sharepoint list. You can also just make sure not to select the 'Start this workflow when a new item is created' or the 'Start this workflow when a new item is changed' check boxes. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:26.000,markdown
No Car Like a Mopar,No-Car-Like-a-Mopar,"<p>I purchased a new car this weekend. It is an 08' Dodge Charger.</p><p>

The thing that really blew me away about this car was that it has a lot more electronic wizardry than any car I have ever had before. It came with Bluetooth, a voice activated audio and nav system, 20 gigabyte hard drive for pictures and MP3s, GPS system with live traffic updates. It even has an USB port for transferring MP3s and pictures.</p><p>

It will probably take me couple months to figure out how to work all of this stuff. I am still trying to figure out how to connect my iPhone so I can use the hands free features in the car. Overall, I am very impressed. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:26.000,markdown

Microsoft: Update Your Documentation in Your SDKs,Microsoft-Update-Your-Documentation-in-Your-SDKs,"<p>I recently downloaded the Sharepoint 2007 SDK from Microsoft's web site. This <a href=""http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms452873.aspx"" target=""_blank"">article</a> is available as part of the version 1.2 SDK that was recently released for Sharepoint 2007. This article includes code samples that do not work, and references an IDE, Visual Studio .NET, that is not used with SDK. If you read the community comments at the bottom of the article, they describe about how the article is ""outdated"". It looks like the examples were written for Sharepoint 2.0, and never got updated to 3.0. </p><p>
</p><p>
Currently with the WSS 3.0 SDK, you do not have have to add all of the references at the top of the article. In Visual Studio 2005 with the 3.0 SDK, it creates the references to Sharepoint automatically, and it will automatically install the web part on the Sharepoint server if it is on the same machine with Visual Studio. Part of my job now as a consultant is too advise my clients on how to leverage certain Microsoft development technologies. Good documentation and books on Sharepoint are few and far between. Many of the books on Sharepoint 2007 were rushed to press while it was still in beta, and content of the books reflect that they are referring to the betas.</p><p>

At the very least, Microsoft should keep their online documentation up to date.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:27.000,markdown

Dell on the other hand does not inovate, they rely on Microsoft and Linux to do the inovating. Dell is not a technology company, they are a logitics company. Apple has applied a lot of those principles to their business, but they did not forget about design in the process.</p><p>

</p><p>
I just learned today from a friend of mine that a Tampa based Drummer Jeff Wood passed away. I had the pleasure of knowing Jeff when he was the drummer in Barely Pink. Jeff was diagnosed with brain cancer and been fighting it for many years.</p><p>
</p><p>
Jeff was in a lot of different bands in the Tampa Bay area. On top of being an amazing drummer, Jeff was also a great vocalist.</p><p>
</p><p>
Here is note I got from Mark Warren this morning;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
The Tampa Bay music scene lost one of its own and it hurts bad. Following a long struggle with brain cancer, Jeff Wood passed away yesterday. Beloved by all who knew him, Jeff was a constant on the scene for more than 20 years, playing drums with an intensity and passion you'd rarely see even amongst his drumming heroes. The guy was the real deal, a good friend to have and any band privileged to count him as a member was better for it. And he played with a lot of them over the years -- odds are, if you've been a musician for any length of time in Tampa Bay, either you've been in a band with Jeff or you know someone who has. The Vodkanauts are no exception -- guitarist Mark Warren played with Jeff while a member of power-poppers Barely Pink and V'nauts drummer Stan Arthur was Jeff's successor in Barely Pink. Notice the avoidance of the word ""replacement"" as Jeff Wood is, was and always will be irreplaceable, truly a one-of-a-kind both as a musician and a human being. Our thoughts go out to Jeff's incredible family, girlfriend Vicki and everyone who's feeling this loss as deeply as we are. It's not gonna be easy but we will get through this.</p><p>
</p><p>
Whenever tragedies like this occur, it serves as a reminder of just how brief our stay on the big blue marble can be and how abruptly it can come to a halt. With that in mind, we urge you to tell your loved ones just how much you care about them on a regular and frequent basis. If there's amends to make, do it now. And if you've got dreams, don't hesitate another moment to realize them.</p><p>

Peace.</p><p>

RTFM and Why I Should not be Allowed Inside a Computer Anymore,RTFM-and-Why-I-Should-not-be-Allowed-Inside-a-Computer-Anymore,"<p>I recently purchased Adobe Creative Suite 3 for my Mac G5 tower. When I bought the suite I did not realize that it required a minimum of 1 Gigabyte of RAM to install. I only had 512 MB that came with the Mac when I bought it, so I decided to buy some more RAM.</p><p>
</p><p>
This is where my nightmare started. When I came home with my i Gig RAM stick, I installed it, and turned my computer on to find out that it did see the stick of RAM. </p><p>
</p><p>
Then I seated the stick in all the way, restarted the computer, and the computer flashed the status light twice.</p><p>
</p><p>
This is when I decided to break out the manual. I have a T-shirt that says 'RTFM', but I did not follow my own ethos.</p><p>
</p><p>
The manual for the G5 says that two flashes means that it can not see the RAM in the computer. It also says that the RAM sticks have to be in opposing RAM bays. </p><p>
</p><p>
Since I only had one stick, I had to go back to the Computer store and buy a second stick that was identical to the one I purchased. This is when the computer store guy says to me, ""oh, you have a dual processor machine.""</p><p>
</p><p>
So I put the other RAM stick in the opposing RAM bay, and the computer started up without a problem. This is why I should not be allowed back in a computer for the foreseeable future.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:28.000,markdown
Consuming ColdFusion Web Services in Microsoft InfoPath,Consuming-ColdFusion-Web-Services-in-Microsoft-InfoPath,"<p>I have been using Microsoft Office InfoPath in some recent projects. One of the nice features of InfoPath is the ability to consume SOAP based web services. This can be used to pre-populate fields in the InfoPath form, or to submit the form to a web service once the user has finished filling out the form.</p><p>
</p><p>
I decided to test some different web services with InfoPath, and I received the following error when I tried to use InfoPath with a ColdFusion based web service; [code:c#]</p><p>
InfoPath cannot work with this Web service because it uses RPC encoding. Only document literal encoding is supported.</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
There is actually a very easy way to fix this if you are using ColdFusion 7 or greater, and that is to use the style attribute in the cfcomponent tag.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
<cfcomponent style=""document""></p><p>
...</p><p>
</cfcomponent></p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
There are four different ways a SOAP based web service can be encoded, but the two most popular are rpc encoded and document literal. ColdFusion by default uses rpc encoded and .NET by default uses document literal.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you are trying to use an existing rpc encoded web service that is used by other applications, do not change the component style because this will break the existing applications that are consuming this web service. Write a proxy service that that uses document literal to talk to the InfoPath form.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:28.000,markdown

Undeliverable/Returned Mail Spam,UndeliverableReturned-Mail-Spam,"<p>I try to avoid getting political on this blog, but I started noticing something alarming a couple of weeks ago with my inbox. I am receiving a couple of extra hundred emails a day that are undeliverable emails being returned to my inbox because my email address is listed as the sender. I did a little research on the interweb, only to find this is nothing new. Spam is a reality for anyone who has had an email account for any length of time. I use filters and anti-spam software, but I still get more and more spam to the point now my personal email address is almost unusable.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have a lot of friends who are against the death penalty, and want to see it done away with for good. I am taking the opposing view as of today.</p><p>
</p><p>
Not only do I believe we should keep the death penalty, but it should be extended to cover spammers. I also believe the death penalty should be extended to people who complain about airport noise after they build a house next to an airport, but that is a whole other blog entry.</p><p>
</p><p>
CAN-SPAM was supposed to fix this, but the problem has only gotten worse since the law was passed. The only real solution is a technological one. The fear of incarceration, or even death will not stop spammers.</p><p>
</p><p>

I am going to be giving a presentation on Excel Services, and how to integrate them into your applications.</p><p>

Auto Documenting SQL Server 2005 Stored Procedures,Auto-Documenting-SQL-Server-2005-Stored-Procedures,"<p>One of the features I like most about ColdFusion 8 is the cfdbinfo tag. The cfdbinfo tag allows developers to view database meta information such as tables, columns and data types. Another nice thing about the cfdbinfo tag is that it will work with most RDBMS servers.</p><p>
</p><p>
Each database server, whether it is Oracle, MySql or MS SQL Server, all have different ways of getting this meta information. CFDBINFO gives ColdFusion developers a nice level of abstraction from these different ways of accessing meta information. I am currently trying to document all of the stored procedures I wrote for a project I just finished. I decided I wanted to try to automate this task, so I wrote ColdFusion script to list my stored procedures. The following code shows how you can use the cfdbinfo tag to list all of your stored procedures.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
<cfdbinfo datasource=""dataSourceName"" type=""procedures"" name=""myprocs"" /></p><p>
		</p><p>
<cfdump var=""#myprocs#"" /></p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
This may be enough information for some users, but I also wanted to display all of the input and output parameters as well as the code in the procedure as well.</p><p>
</p><p>
I work with SQL Server 2005 as my primary database engine. All of the database meta information can be accessed through system views known as INFORMATION_SCHEMAs. There are two views that I used to get the information about my procedures that I wanted. They are the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARAMETERS views.</p><p>
</p><p>
I used the following query to get the meta information that I needed for my documentation;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
<cfquery datasource=""FACTS"" name=""storedprocs""></p><p>
	SELECT r.SPECIFIC_SCHEMA, r.SPECIFIC_NAME, r.ROUTINE_DEFINITION,</p><p>
		p.ORDINAL_POSITION, p.PARAMETER_MODE, p.PARAMETER_NAME, p.DATA_TYPE</p><p>
	FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES r</p><p>
		JOIN INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARAMETERS p</p><p>
			ON r.SPECIFIC_SCHEMA = p.SPECIFIC_SCHEMA</p><p>
				AND r.SPECIFIC_NAME = p.SPECIFIC_NAME</p><p>
	WHERE r.ROUTINE_TYPE = 'PROCEDURE'</p><p>
	ORDER BY r.SPECIFIC_SCHEMA, r.SPECIFIC_NAME, p.ORDINAL_POSITION</p><p>
</cfquery></p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
I then used the following code to display the stored procedures in my database;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
<cfoutput query=""storedprocs"" group=""SPECIFIC_NAME""></p><p>
			<h2>#SPECIFIC_SCHEMA#.#SPECIFIC_NAME#</h2></p><p>
			<p>The parameters and data types for the #SPECIFIC_SCHEMA#.#SPECIFIC_NAME# procedure are as follows;</p></p><p>
				<ol></p><p>
					<cfoutput></p><p>
						<li>#PARAMETER_MODE#, #PARAMETER_NAME#, #DATA_TYPE#</li></p><p>
					</cfoutput></p><p>
				</ol></p><p>
			<p>Here is the transact-sql for the #SPECIFIC_SCHEMA#.#SPECIFIC_NAME# procedure.</p></p><p>
			<div class=""solid""></p><p>
				<pre>#ROUTINE_DEFINITION#</pre><br /><br /></p><p>
			</div></p><p>

"iPhone is Almost Here, and I am Still not Getting One",iPhone-is-Almost-Here-and-I-am-Still-not-Getting-One,"<p>I have posted on this before, but the iPhone is coming out tomorrow. I am still not getting an iPhone.</p><p>
</p><p>
The biggest criticism I have seen for the iPhone is that Edge network is slow. My current Cingular phone is a 3G phone, and I get pretty good reception here in Jacksonville. Here are the other reasons why I am not getting one; No Mobile Java, No mobile Flash and no GPS. That being said, it is also a closed platform. My current cell phone, which is not a Smart phone can still run third party applications.</p><p>
</p><p>
YouTube is re-encoding all their videos for H264. Apple could have just supported Flash FLV, and YouTube would not have to re-encode all of their video.</p><p>
</p><p>
I guess AT&T and Apple are afraid that Skype are going to kill off AT&T's long distance business.</p><p>
</p><p>
I also think that some of the arguments against the iPhone are bogus. The complaint I have heard is battery life. Most cell phones turn the screen off when they are not in use. I have also read a lot of complaints about the touch screen. I think the virtual keyboard make a lot more sense than the current qwerty keyboards that ship with some smart phones. The keyboard on my Blackberry really sucked.</p><p>
</p><p>
If Apple where to offer 3G and GPS, I would buy an iPhone. Hopefully Apple will fix this with the next rev of the iPhone.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:29.000,markdown

Microsoft SQL Server 2005 running on Mac OS X,Microsoft-SQL-Server-2005-running-on-Mac-OS-X,"<p>I bought one of the new MacBook Pros last week. I absolutely love it. I have used a couple of different database engines on the Mac in the past such as MySQL, Sybase, Oracle and more recently Derby. Because the processors in my Mac where based on PowerPC processors, I was never able to run SQL Server with out some type of emulation. Anyone who ever ran Virtual PC on the Mac knows what I am talking about. I installed boot camp on the Mac initially with Windows XP. I downloaded the trial of Parallels Desktop 3.0 for the Mac and and it will use the boot camp partition.</p><p>
</p><p>
I then installed the developer edition of SQL Server 2005 on XP. I have the beta of ColdFusion 8 running on my Mac, and I wanted to be able to access the database I was running on Parallels. Initially I could not get this to work. The default setup of Parallels does not allow the Mac to access servers running on Parallels. I was able to get this to work by changing the networking on Parallels to ""Bridged Ethernet"". I can now access SQL Server through JDBC on my Mac through parallels.</p><p>
</p><p>
I am getting ready to work on a project using Oracle 10g. I will most likely run it the same way I am running SQL Server, just with a different operation system.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:30.000,markdown

What does Serialized CFCs Mean for Enterprise ColdFusion Developers,What-does-Serialized-CFCs-Mean-for-Enterprise-ColdFusion-Developers,"<p>One of the problems in the past with ColdFusion has been that you could not load CFCs into the session scope of your server in clustered environments, and have those CFCs replicate to the memory of the other app servers in your cluster. The issue was that session scope memory stayed resident in the memory of the application server. You could replicate simple data such as strings, but complex objects would not. In the Java world you can serialize java objects across servers. There have been workarounds such as maintaining sessions onto a single server through sticky sessions or using the request scope. The problems with these approaches is that you either had to keep your CFCs for a session on a single server, so if the app server died, you lost all of the session data. If you use the request scope, you have to reload the CFCs for every request, which is an expensive operation. Neither one of these approaches is ideal for scalable web applications.</p><p>
</p><p>
With the release of ColdFusion 8 you now have the same ability to serialize CFCs in the session scope over multiple servers. This is not perfect either because there is some latency in replicating session data over multiple servers. Given the latency issues, you still gain in the redundancy of having session data replicated over a cluster of servers.</p><p>
</p><p>
So why is this so important? The answer is that you can use persisted objects in a clustered environment. A perfect scenario for this new functionality is a shopping cart. Shopping cart data is typically transactional, but still need to be persisted. After the shopping cart goes to a checkout is usually when that data needs to be placed into a database. Before that the shopping cart can stay in session memory.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
</p><p>
<cfset Session.shoppingCart = createObject(""component"",""com.mycompany.ShoppingCart"") /></p><p>
</p><p>
<cfset Session.shoppingCart.AddItem(itemSku=""STCF9080"",quantity=1) /></p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
The Session.shoppingCart can now be persisted across page requests and application servers. If the server I am requesting crashes, my object will still be alive on the other application servers on the cluster.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you are planning on using this new feature in ColdFusion 8, I would suggest doing research on session clustering. There are some good articles on how to configure app servers for clustering and replication session data. It is worthwhile to do research on how to set up NIC cards for replicating session data, and how many application servers you can cluster together without losing performance to latency.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:31.000,markdown
"Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Rich Client Apps and Google Gears",Bill-Gates-Steve-Jobs-Rich-Client-Apps-and-Google-Gears,"<p>I was watching some of the interview with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates interview yesterday from the D5 conference. Bill and Steve got a question if Mac OS X and Windows applications are dinosaurs compared to new browser based applications. </p><p>
</p><p>
Steve Jobs made a point that he thought there is room for these applications that are made to run on the desktop, but can use Internet base services. He gave an example of a Google Maps application that runs on the iPhone. He said it works better than any browser based application. They showed vision about the idea that there is room for hybrid rich client applications that use web services.</p><p>
</p><p>
At the same time Google has released a browser plugin called 'Gears'. Gears is still in pre-release, but it has a local server, a database and messaging components. This allows developers to write disconnected applications. It is my understanding that some of these components are being included in Adobe Apollo. The database component is based on SQLite, which is the same engine used by Mac OS X for searching. It is an extremely lite weight database engine, and can be accessed with JavaScript.</p><p>

"Computerworld, Is ColdFusion Dead, lets analyze the facts",Computerworld-Is-ColdFusion-Dead-lets-analyze-the-facts,"<p>Lets analyze the facts. Is ColdFusion Dead? Full disclosure. I just switched jobs a couple of months ago, and I am no longer a full time ColdFusion developer. When I switched jobs, I was asked the same question by a co-worker at my new job, ""I thought ColdFusion was dead?"" after I told him about my previous experience. I could see where someone would get that impression if you were to base it solely on Adobe's marketing of CF.</p><p>
</p><p>
In Mary Brandel's ""opinion piece"", she states the following;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
This once-popular Web programming language -- released in the mid-1990s by Allaire Corp. (which was later purchased by Macromedia Inc., which itself was acquired by Adobe Systems Inc.) -- has since been superseded by other development platforms, including Microsoft Corp.'s Active Server Pages and .Net, as well as Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP and other open-source languages.</p><p>
</p><p>
Debates continue over whether ColdFusion is as robust and scalable as its competitors, but nevertheless, premiums paid for ColdFusion programmers have dropped way off, according to Foote. ""It was really popular at one time, but the market is now crowded with other products,"" he says.</p><p>
</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
So lets analyze this sentence by sentence. Brandel states that ColdFusion was once-popular. It is ""once-popular"" when you consider it has always been a popular web application language since it was released in 1995. Back then you could write CGI applications in C++, or use ColdFusion and ASP. ColdFusion quickly became popular because it was easier to develop for then ASP or C++. Later on in the 90s PHP and JSP became popular options, but neither are as easy to use as CF.</p><p>
</p><p>
Brandel goes on to mention that ColdFusion has been superseded by .NET, Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP and other open-source languages. She kind of lumps application servers with languages. .NET and Java are both application runtime environments that can be run on desktops, phones and servers. They can also run multiple languages. ColdFusion currently runs on top of Java, and can be used in conjuction with Java. The two products actually compliment each other. New Atlanta makes a CFML engine that runs on .NET called BlueDragon.NET.</p><p>

I have done some PHP programming, and I like PHP as a scripting language, but not as much as CFML. You can still write web apps quicker in CFML than in PHP. Unlike Ruby on Rails and Python, CFML and PHP are made from the ground up to be a web scripting language. Python requires that the code be indented, which makes it next to impossible to combine inline HTML with your code. Ruby on Rails is not a language, it is a web application framework. 37 signals has automated a lot of things in Rails, including scaffolding and AJAX, but the underlying language is Ruby. Ruby is probably easier to learn than Perl, but it is still just a system scripting language.</p><p>
</p><p>
Brandel goes on to write that ""Debates continue over whether ColdFusion is as robust and scalable as its competitors"". .NET and Java both scale extremely well. Since ColdFusion runs on top of Java, it also scales very well. I just came from a company that had a hosted solution the ran on a web farm of clustered servers. Their customers included Fortune 100 companies. There is no debate, ColdFusion does scale. The same can not be said about other technologies like Ruby on Rails. Two of my favorite sites are running on Rails. They are Twitter and Basecamp. Both of these sites are down constantly, or at least run extremely slow because Rails does not scale well.</p><p>
</p><p>
She also said that premiums for ColdFusion developers have fallen. I am not sure what time frame she is writing about because my phone was ringing off the hook when I was in my last job transition a couple of months ago. There was a period around 2002 after the Dot Com bust where there was a drop off in salaries, but I found that to be the case for all development. Saleries are actually higher now for ColdFusion than I have ever seen them in the past.</p><p>
</p><p>
Brandel goes on to quote David Foote who says ""It was really popular at one time, but the market is now crowded with other products."" Lets analyze this bit of brilliance from Mr. Foote. If anything there are fewer competing products then there were in the late 90s. Many of the smaller products have died or have withered on the vine. If you look at Python and Ruby, they are actually older than ColdFusion. If you also look at the number of development jobs out in the marketplace, ColdFusion outnumbers Rails jobs by a factor of two. </p><p>
</p><p>
In the Computerworld article, Brandel compares ColdFusion to non-relational databases, COBOL, and OS/2. ColdFusion is still being sold, supported and developed into new versions by one of the largest software companies on the planet, unlike OS/2. Brandel mentions that ColdFusion was acquired from Allaire by Macromedia, and Macromedia by Adobe. I think the fact that a software product is being purchased by an even larger software company is a good thing, not bad.</p><p>
</p><p>
There are no less than five different application servers that run CFML applications. Some of these are open source projects. Plenty of options from multiple vendors.</p><p>
</p><p>
Op-Ed pieces like this are typical of pubs like Computerworld and Wired nowadays. I guess it is to be considered when you realize that Adobe has completely mishandled the marketing of ColdFusion. One has to ask how Ruby on Rails has garnered such positive press with no advertising budget, and ColdFusion gets an ""It is dead"" article every three months.</p><p>

This once-popular Web programming language -- released in the mid-1990s by Allaire Corp. (which was later purchased by Macromedia Inc., which itself was acquired by Adobe Systems Inc.) -- has since been superseded by other development platforms, including Microsoft Corp.'s Active Server Pages and .Net, as well as Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP and other open-source languages. Debates continue over whether ColdFusion is as robust and scalable as its competitors, but nevertheless, premiums paid for ColdFusion programmers have dropped way off, according to Foote. ""It was really popular at one time, but the market is now crowded with other products,"" he says.</p><p>

Encapsulating your Business Logic in CFCs vs Stored Procedures,Encapsulating-your-Business-Logic-in-CFCSs-vs-Stored-Procedures,"<p>John Lyons had a <a href=""http://john.lyons-den.org/index.cfm/2007/5/8/So-Which-is-better-a-stored-procedure-or--a-cfc"" target=""_blank"">post</a> about whether to encapsulate your business logic in CFCs vs. Stored Procedures. The answer to this question is ""it depends"". I used to work at a company that used SQL Server stored procedures for all of the business logic in our applications. One of the reasons we did this was because we had some applications that were written in VB, and others that were written in ColdFusion that accessed the same databases. Using stored procedures allowed us to have a single point of entry and one set of code that we had to maintain for that business logic.</p><p>
</p><p>
If all of your applications were written in ColdFusion, I would use CFCs to encapsulate that business logic. It is easier for most developers to maintain CFCs than it is to maintain T-SQL. Stored Procedures are an database object, and they may be difficult to promote to your QA and production servers depending on how your security is set up. </p><p>
</p><p>
There is also no speed advantage to using MS SQL Server stored procedures over inline SQL statements. If you are using an Oracle database server, there may be a speed advantage to writing your PL-SQL as stored procedures. If I was using Oracle, I would probably use stored procedures with my most of my business logic in my CFCs.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:32.000,markdown
Microsoft adds Dynamic Language Runtime support to .NET,Microsoft-adds-Dynamic-Language-Runtime-support-to-NET,"<p>There are a number of dynamic languages that are already supported by .NET, such as Iron Python and JavaScript, but according to this <a href=""http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2123793,00.asp"" target=""_blank"">article</a> at eWeek, Microsoft has made this easier to do with a dynamic language runtime. The article inteviews Jim Hugunin and John Lam of Microsoft about the language support. Their work was done primarily for Iron Python, but it seems to me that it should make that much easier to support other dynamic scripting languages such as CFML. </p><p>
</p><p>
It is becoming clear that dynamic languages are becoming more popular than statically typed languages such as Java, C# and C++. There are currently a number of dynamic languages that have been gaining interest such as Ruby, JRuby, Perl, Python, Groovy and Scala. CFML is a dynamic scripting language that should see some benefit from this renewed interest in scripting languages.</p><p>

"T-SQL is case insensitive, XQuery is Case Sensitive",TSQL-is-case-insensitive-XQuery-is-Case-Sensitive,"<p>One of the nice new features in SQL Server 2005 is the inclusion of an XML data type. Microsoft added the ability to use XQuery searches to pull values from this type. [code:c#]</p><p>

DECLARE @PersonID int;</p><p>
</p><p>

Serialize name value pairs into XML in SQL Server,Serialize-name-value-pairs-into-XML-in-SQL-Server,"<p>I wrote a gateway service that allowed an Oracle database server to talk to a SQL Server database server about two years ago in ColdFusion MX 6.1.  Back then I was able to use a centralized auditing table to store all of the inserts and update values. At my current job I am writing a lot of stored procedures, and I wanted to do the same thing just in Transact SQL. In ColdFusion it is fairly easy to serialize complex data into a string using WDDX.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
<cfset myStruct = StructNew() /></p><p>
<cfset myStruct.myString = 'My string' /></p><p>
<cfset myStruct.myInt = 12 /></p><p>
<cfset myStruct.myBool = false /></p><p>
<cfwddx action=""cfml2wddx"" input=""#myStruct#"" output=""myWDDXVar"" /></p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
You can do something similar to this to serialize name value pairs in SQL.</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
DECLARE @myTable TABLE (myString NVARCHAR(128) NULL, myInt INT NULL, myBool BIT)</p><p>
DECLARE @myXML XML</p><p>
</p><p>
INSERT INTO @myTable</p><p>
SELECT 'My string' AS myString, 12 AS myInt, 0 AS myBool</p><p>
</p><p>
SET @myXML = (SELECT *</p><p>
					FROM @myTable AS myTable</p><p>
					FOR XML AUTO)</p><p>
[/code]></p><p>
</p><p>
If you are using SQL Server 2005, you can store the XML value into a XML column or cast it into a NVARCHAR(MAX) or NTEXT column.</p><p>
</p><p>
The result will look like the following;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
<myTable myString=""My string"" myInt=""12"" myBool=""0"" /></p><p>

How to upload legacy DTS Packages into a SQL Server 2005 server,How-to-upload-legacy-DTS-Packages-into-a-SQL-Server-2005-server,"<p>I am working on project to migrate some existing DTS Packages that were created in SQL Server 2000 over to SQL Server 2005. I have been trying to use SQL SMO, which is the prefered Microsoft way to script and program SQL Server. SMO does have a way to import SSIS packages to SQL Server 2005, but it will not work with the older DTS packages.</p><p>
</p><p>
Buck Woody at Microsoft pointed me in the right direction on how to get this working. SQL DMO is the old COM library  for scripting and programming SQL Server. The SQL DMO library still works with SQL Server 2005. I created a C# app to import a SQL Server 2000 structured storage file into the 2005 server. </p><p>
</p><p>
The first thing I did was add a reference for the Microsoft DTSPackage Object Library in the list of COM objects.</p><p>
</p><p>
I then used the following code to import the DTS file into the SQL Server;</p><p>
</p><p>
[code:c#]</p><p>
string package = @""C:\DTSTest\ImportSample.dts"";</p><p>
            object pVarPersistStgOfHost = null;</p><p>
            DTS.Package myPackage = new DTS.Package();</p><p>
            myPackage.LoadFromStorageFile(package, """", null, null, null, ref pVarPersistStgOfHost);</p><p>
            myPackage.SaveToSQLServer(""10.25.15.0"", null, null, </p><p>
                DTSSQLServerStorageFlags.DTSSQLStgFlag_UseTrustedConnection, </p><p>
                null, null, null,</p><p>
                ref pVarPersistStgOfHost, false);</p><p>
<code/></p><p>
</p><p>
You will need to add some additional code to unmarshall DTS.Package object.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:34.000,markdown

</p><p>
I posted the following comment to his blog post; It is going to take more than marketing money. If you look at Ruby On Rails, 37 Signals has been able to effectively market Ruby without spending hardly any money. Most of the marketing has been viral for RoR.</p><p>
</p><p>
Tim and Ben are both preparing trips to user groups right now to start promoting ColdFusion 8. I think that will help, but Adobe really needs to look at how some of these other scripting languages have been marketed. Python and Ruby, both scripting languages, have been gaining popularity over Java and C#. ColdFusion is a scripting language, and I would argue easier to use than Python or RoR. Adobe should be able to leverage that increase interest in developing web applications using scripting languages.</p><p>
</p><p>
Right now ColdFusion has about a 6% market share. That should be higher when you look at the other languages that compete with ColdFusion.</p><p>
</p><p>
Keep in mind that Ruby, Perl and Python are all open source products. These are community projects without a company like Adobe to market it as a product.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:35.000,markdown

Why I will probably not be buying an iPhone,Why-I-will-probably-not-be-buying-an-iPhone,"<p>The biggest reason I will not be buying an Apple iPhone is they are not on sell yet, but that is not the only reason.</p><p>
</p><p>
Now that I have left the Steve Jobs <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field"" target=""_blank"">reality distortion field</a>, there are a lot of features that I do like about the iPhone. I think the interface for the iPhone is truly revolutionary. From the demo I saw at the MacWorld keynote, the touch screen makes since for the best user input device for a smart phone. I had a Blackberry last year as my primary phone, but I was never really liked it that much.</p><p>
</p><p>
The iPhone is also missing a number of things that I have in my current phone. My current phone is a Cingular 3G phone. The iPhone is only an EDGE phone. It looks like Apple is compensating for that with WiFi built into the phone.</p><p>
</p><p>
It also looks like you will have to be a Cingular customer to get the phone. I hope that you will still be able to buy the phone unlocked. I think it is good that it is a GSM phone. In the US, there are only two GSM providers I know about, but this is the standard used outside the United States by most providers.</p><p>

Does ColdFusion need 64 bit Support? Short answer: Yes!,Does-ColdFusion-need-64-bit-Support-Short-answer-Yes,"<p>Does ColdFusion need 64 bit support? The short answer to this question is yes, but it really depends on the ROI if Adobe charges more for the 64 bit version. My company is currently in the process of upgrading to 64 bit servers, but only where it makes sense.</p><p>
</p><p>
SQL Server 2005 has a 32 bit and a 64 bit version. The 64 bit version takes advantage of the 64 bit chips, but it also costs a lot more. Factor in the cost of the 64 bit version of Windows 2003 Server OS, and it gets pricey.</p><p>
</p><p>
From my tests with SSIS on this new hardware, ETLs that used to take hours now take minutes to run. Granted a lot of the speed improvements have come from code optimizations in SQL Server, but there is still a huge improvement from using the 64 bit hardware.</p><p>
</p><p>
It would be nice to see 64 bit version of ColdFusion. I know it would require having a 64 bit OS and JVM, but it would be nice to see ColdFusion take advantage of this new hardware.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:36.000,markdown

Adobe is not the only vendor who has been slow to update JRun to the latest Java EE spec. Almost every major Java vendor is taking their time upgrading their respective app servers.</p><p>
</p><p>
This Dr. Dobbs <a href=""http://www.ddj.com/dept/java/193302854"" target=""_top"">article</a> reports on what the different vendors are doing when it comes to Java EE 5. Right now ColdFusion is only supported on J2EE 1.4.2. So there is no reason for anyone who is doing dual development on the same server to upgrade to 5.</p><p>
</p><p>
IBM's WebSphere will not be upgraded again until 2008, and I believe JBoss is on a similiar time frame for their upgrade.</p><p>
</p><p>
At my company we use JRun, and it has done an excelent job in our enterprise environment. We do most of our development in CFML, so this has not been a major issue. If we did more Java development, we would probably use another vendor.</p><p>

Avm2 is the compiler used in Flash 9 for running ActionScript 3. AS3 is based on the ECMAScript 4, and is the same as what the next version of JavaScript.</p><p>
</p><p>
Avm2 is extremely fast because it is very similar to how the Java VM and the .NET CLR work. Right now in most browsers JavaScript is interpreted. When Mozilla switches over to the avm2 compiler, their browser will be able to take advantage of this technology for executing JavaScript code on the page.</p><p>

With more and more web sites using advanced JavaScript for things like AJAX applications, this will a positive impact on the overall performace of these applications.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:38.000,markdown

Now all presidential and other national candidates use the internet for their campaigns. Nancy Pelosi has even posted videos onto YouTube. Unfortunately, local politicians and Judges do not use the internet. Local politicians and judges have a much greater affect on our lives than national politicians. Only two judicial candidates had websites. How hard is it for a city councilman to get a blogger account or post a video onto YouTube explaining their positions on issues.</p><p>

Book Review: iWoz,Book-Review-iWoz,"<p>I just finished reading iWoz, Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak's autobiography. The book was co-written by Gina Smith, but is written in the first person.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have been a fan of a lot of the work that Steve and Apple did in the early 70's and 80's. I owned, or I should say that my parents owned an Apple II. Steve designed the Apple II, according to the book, all by himself. He says he wanted to set the record about a lot of misconceptions about him and Apple. He designed the Apple I and the Apple II by himself. Steve Jobs did not design the Apple computers. He says that he never quit working at Apple. He still is an employee for Apple to this day.</p><p>
</p><p>
The first half of the book covers what he did as an engineer before he and Jobs started Apple. He talks a lot about his parents and the influence they had on him as a child, teaching him about electronics, ethics and education. His father was an engineer, and his mother was a teacher.</p><p>
</p><p>
I don't want to talk about too much of what is in the book, because I think everyone should read the book. With that said, I think one of the interesting things about the book is the lack of a forward. Steve Jobs was supposed to write the forward, but backed out right before the book was published. After reading the book, I can understand why he didn't. The book does not make Jobs look very good.</p><p>
</p><p>
In the book Woz says that Steve screwed him out of several thousand dollars on the hardware design he did for breakout at Atari. He says that he did not mind because he wound up making millions on Apple. Later on in the book, he talks about the remote control he designed at Cloud Nine. Frog design did the case design, which was the same company that did designs for Apple at the time. Woz was told that Jobs saw the remote control, and threw it against the wall, and put it in a box, and told Frog to send that design to Woz.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the things I found interesting was that Woz created the BASIC interpreter for the Apple I and the Apple II. He knew that Bill Gates had done the BASIC for the Altair, and he wanted to do a BASIC. My understanding was that Bill Gates copied the basic he used from DEC, and made it work on the Altair with help from Paul Allen and another engineer. Woz did it all by himself. I learned how to program using that BASIC interpreter in the Apple II.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:38.000,markdown

A lot of content available for XML presentation,A-lot-of-content-available-for-XML-presentation,"<p>I finished creating my presentation on XML yesterday. One of the things that became obvious was that there is a lot more than an hours worth of content on XML.</p><p>
</p><p>
Even with all of the XML features in ColdFusion, there are still some shortcomings in the way that ColdFusion handles XML. One of the key parts of the presentation will be StAX, the new Java API for dealing with XML. One of the key features of StAX is that it uses a pull parser when dealing with large XML files.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the issues I have run into with using large XML files in ColdFusion is you have to load the whole file into memory in order for the DOM parser to work.</p><p>
</p><p>
Using a stream based parser is much more effecient when dealing with large XML files because it does not have to load the whole file into memory.</p><p>

Photoshop is too expensive!!!,Photoshop-is-too-expensive,"<p>I had a conversation with someone today about the cost of Photoshop CS2. The current price listed on the website is $649.00. This is the full version. Photoshop elements 5.0, the lost cost alternative, goes for about 89.00.</p><p>
</p><p>
My dad refers to Photoshop Elements as ""Photshop for Dummies"". It can't even do channels, and it is only for Windows. The full version of photoshop is one of the most pirated pieces of software out there on the web. Adobe knows this, and this is why they so many levels of copy protection.</p><p>
</p><p>
There is a economic term refered to Elasticity of price. The idea here is that the demand for a product will increase if the price lowers, and it will decrease as the price increases. </p><p>
</p><p>
The theory here is that Adobe would sell more copies of Photoshop if they lowered the price, and would have less piracy.</p><p>
</p><p>
I used to do photo retouching for a living. When I did, my company purchased the full version for me to use. I no longer do any kind of graphic arts for a living. I do have a digital camera, but I no longer have a copy of Photoshop. I can't justify spending 649 dollars on software that I would only use as a hobby. </p><p>
</p><p>
I think the solution for Adobe is to have three different price points for Photoshop. They could have the full version and elements at the current prices, but have a version of Photoshop that had most of the features of the full version for around $299. The inbetween version of Photoshop would have features like layers, history, channels and paths.</p><p>
</p><p>
I personally feel that this would cut down on the piracy, and Adobe would make a lot more money.</p><p>

It is extremely dificult right now to deploy ColdFusion for JBOSS, but it is possible. Adobe might be planning to use JBOSS for their future J2EE development, and just deploy ColdFusion on top of JBOSS for their Standalone version.</p><p>

Flex Builder 2 30 day trial behavior,Flex-Builder-2-30-day-trial-behavior,"<p>The 30 day trial for Flex Builder 2 just ended on my laptop. I am still in the process of trying to convince my company to buy me a license.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you have the standalone version of Flex Builder 2, and were curious what happen when the trial ends, here is what I have observed. Flex Builder 2 is built on the Eclipse IDE platform. I was using Eclipse before I started using Flex 2, but I decided to download the standalone version because of some behaviors that are different between the plugin and the standalone version. The differences were mainly how Eclipse builds and launches apps and some keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>
</p><p>
When my trial ended, I went to the Manage Flex licenses... menu option under the help menu. Before the trial ended it gave the option of entering in the key or continuing on. Now it lets you enter in the license key or you can just quit.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you try to open a Flex MXML file, you have the  same option of entering the key or quiting the application.</p><p>
</p><p>
You can use Flex Builder for more than just working with Flex. You can also use Flex Builder with CFEclipse and Java development. After the trial license ends, you can still use Flex Builder with these other plugins, but as soon as you try to work with Flex specific files, the IDE quits. </p><p>
</p><p>
In the mean time, I am going to reinstall Eclipse until I can get the license key for Flex.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:41.000,markdown

Who misspelled Referrer,Who-misspelled-Referrer,"<p>Was it Sir Tim? I have always been curious who the developer was who misspelled referrer. The 'Referer' in the http cgi is the variable that represents the site or page you came from originally. In ColdFusion you can access this variable with cgi.HTTP_Referer. </p><p>
</p><p>
Spelling has never been one of my strong points, and anyone who reads this blog on a regular basis knows this already. I was always curious who the developer was who misspelled referrer. And is it actually misspelled if he developer was from a country where referer is the correct spelling? </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:41.000,markdown
Fusebox Unity?,Fusebox-Unity,"<p>I am preparing a presentation on both Fusebox and Model-Glue. The most current version of Model-Glue is called Unity. In this version Joe Rinehart has added ColdSpring and Reactor into the Model-Glue framework.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the neat features of fusebox is the notion of lexicons. Lexicons let you add your own tags or verbs to the framework.</p><p>
</p><p>
I was reading on MXNA that <a href=""http://www.dopefly.com/techblog/entry.cfm?entry=148"">Dope Fly</a> has some downloads that will let you add ColdSpring and Reactor Lexicons to Fusebox. Pretty Cool. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:41.000,markdown

Next JaxFusion pits Fusebox 5 against Model-Glue.,Next-JaxFusion-pits-Fusebox-5-against-ModelGlue,"<p>The next JaxFusion meeting will be on Tuesday, September 5th at Vurv. I will be doing a presentation on Fusebox 5 vs. Model-Glue framework.</p><p>
</p><p>
This presentation will be more of a side by side comparison of the two frameworks. It seems like there is no shortage of web application frameworks nowadays. I am also a fan of Mach-II, but I have not taken a look at any of the other frameworks for ColdFusion. There is a new framework called CF on wheels, kind of a spin on Ruby on Rails.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:42.000,markdown
Spry meets YouTube,Spry-meets-YouTube,"<p>I was speaking to one of my user group members, Luis Casillas, about Spry at our last meeting. I told him I had been thinking about writing a Spry example that searches YouTube tags, displays results, and even loaded the and played the Flash video.</p><p>
</p><p>
Last night I sat down and took a look at the YouTube API. They use REST and XML-RPC interfaces to expose their api. They have good documentation on their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/dev"" target=""_blank"">dev site</a>. I used the REST interface to call their tag search method in COldFusion. It returns an XML file that then consumes the XML through an ColdFusion proxy. This solves cross domain security issues, and allows the XMLHttpObj to call without security warnings. There is an example below. </p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfsilent&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfprocessingdirective pageencoding=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""utf-8""</FONT> /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>

</p><p>
I ran into problems with the XML feed losing the utf-8 encoding coming through COldFusion's CFHTTP tag. I specified utf-8 encoding with the cfprocessingdirective tag as well as the cfhttp tag and the cfcontent tag.</p><p>
</p><p>
All the rest was done in JavaScript, so the page only has to load once. All of the real functionality are Spry Ajax calls using the Spry.Data.XMLDataSet object.</p><p>
</p><p>
I use one DataSet object to perform my searches with, and I wrote two functions to use a form perform the search, and another to display the YouTube Video. The JavaScript code is listed below;</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so.write(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""YouTubeVideo""</FONT>);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>

</p><p>
I used the following form code to perform searches on new tags.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY><FONT COLOR=FF8000>&lt;form name=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""myForm""</FONT> onsubmit=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""""</FONT>&gt;</FONT></FONT><br></p><p>

The next problem I ran into was trying to load the SWF movies dynamically. Khary Mallea turned me on to the SWFObject library. Like Spry, this library dynamically takes care of the browser differences to make sure the movie will always display. Internet Explorer would not load the movies until I added this library.</p><p>

Congratulations to Sean Corfield and the rest of the Fusebox group for getting this release out. I have been beta testing the framework for a new application I have been working on for last couple of weeks.</p><p>

This is the first release of the Fusebox framework that has not required a rewrite of your application to upgrade the framework. All fusebox.xml and circuit.xml files will run as they did in version 4.0 and 4.1.</p><p>
</p><p>
The core files are now CFCs for the most part. There is also a new fusebox.loadclean keyword that can be used to recompile the app from the xml files. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:42.000,markdown

Convincing Your Boss to Get You a Mac for Development,Convincing-Your-Boss-to-Get-You-a-Mac-for-Development,"<p>I was in San Jose last week for the managers summit. While I was out there I noticed that a lot of the developers use Macs.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have been a Mac user since 1990, and I have a G5 for my home machine. I am trying to convince my company that I should get a MacBook Pro to replace my Dell laptop. <a href=""http://www.corfield.org/blog/"">Sean Corfield</a> brought up some good points to me about how to convince your boss to get you a Mac for development.</p><p>
</p><p>
The new MacBook Pro is an Intel based machine. Because it uses an x86 based processor, you can run multiple operating systems on it now. If you use <a href=""http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/"" target=""_blank"">parallels</a>, you can even run multiple OSes at the same time, and test your web apps in each browser.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you host your applications on Unix servers, you can run your apps on the same OS that the server is running since Mac OS X is Unix based.</p><p>
</p><p>
I do not know if I will be able to convince my boss to get me a Mac, but if he does not, I will probably get one to replace my home machine. I just bought my G5 about a year and a half ago, so it will probably be awhile before I replace that machine.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:43.000,markdown

If you have ever thought about becoming a user group manager, I highly suggest becoming one. Macromedia, now Adobe, requires that managers sign a NDA. The managers do get to learn about technology that Adobe has not made available to the general public.</p><p>

World Cup Observations,World-Cup-Observations,"<p>I am a huge sports fan. I wanted to say that before anyone got the wrong idea. I used to play Soccer, or Association Football as my brother-in-law likes to call it, when I was kid and later as an adult. My brother-in-law played professionally in the U.K. I also have played baseball, basketball and I currently crew competitively.</p><p>
</p><p>
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, or so I have been told. If this is true, I really feel sorry for the world. The last two world cup finals I have watched have been decided by kickoff competition.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the things I like about baseball is that there is no tying, or crying for that matter. Both teams play until someone wins. A baseball game usually lasts for nine innings, but it may go 14 or 15 innings before a winner is decided.</p><p>
</p><p>
I think FIFA should change the rules, especially for the final rounds, so that Both teams play until someone scores a goal.</p><p>
</p><p>
Another change that should be adopted is the idea of a penalty box like in Hockey. That way if your captain headbuts another player, instead of getting a red card, he could sit out ten minutes in the box.</p><p>
</p><p>
There are also a lot of dramatics on the field with players falling down like they are hurt, especially when the other team is trying to score a goal. I heard on the news that the doctors for the world cup said that half of the players who do this have no injury at all. They should not stop play if a player falls down.</p><p>
</p><p>
I think FIFA should adopt these changes if they want to remain the ""most popular sport in the world"".</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:43.000,markdown

The Coolest Airline Pilot on the Planet,The-Coolest-Airline-Pilot-on-the-Planet,"<p>I have to give thanks to getting home to Jacksonville from CFUNITED to an airline pilot named ""Rusty"". As my airline experiences have been lately, my flight out of Dulles was delayed. When I finally did get on the plane to fly to Charlotte, I was bemoaning the fact that my connection flight had already left before we took off. The passenger who was in the standby seat behind me was a pilot for the same airline. He told me he was going down to the races in Daytona. I told him I was supposed to go, but I missed my connection.</p><p>
</p><p>
At this point, ""Rusty"", offered to give me a ride to Jacksonville once we landed. I accepted his offer, and we drove to Jacksonville from Charlotte. I would not have made it back last night if it had not been for Rusty.</p><p>

Sean Corfield presents Duck-Typing at CFUNITED,Sean-Corfield-presents-DuckTyping-at-CFUNITED,"<p>I watched Sean Corfield's presentation on duck-typing this morning, and he brought up very valid points on why we should not type parameters and returntypes.</p><p>
</p><p>
The bigest advantage that I saw was performace. Sean said he was able to improve performance of the fusebox XML compile by 2-3 times. Joe Rinehart was in the audience and said he witnessed the same imrovement in speed for Model-Glue.</p><p>
</p><p>
Since ColdFusion does not require types like Java does, we should take advantage of that ability. You still have to use typing when writting SOAP based Web Services and Flex marshalling.</p><p>
</p><p>
Duck-Typing also makes unit testing easier because you can reuse your tests for multiple objects.</p><p>
</p><p>
He mentioned that Michael and Judith Dinowitz, and Hal Helms have written articles on duck typing. </p><p>
</p><p>
I will try to post links later in my comments.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:43.000,markdown
Dave Ross presentation on ColdSpring,Dave-Ross-presentation-on-ColdSpring,"<p>I went to Dave Ross's presentation on ColdSpring at CFUNITED. It was an extremely informative presentation on the ColdSpring frame work that Dave developed. ColdSpring is based on the Java Spring framework. It makes it much easier to create service factories for creating objects. It also includes a framework for Aspect Oriented Programming.</p><p>
</p><p>
Dave mentioned that the examples that are always given of AOP are logging and security, but it can also be used for managing transactions as well as caching.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:44.000,markdown

MVC for you and me presentation by Joe Rinehart,MVC-for-you-and-me-presentation-by-Joe-Rinehart,"<p>I have never seen Joe Rinehart speak before, so I was curious to see his MVC presentation.</p><p>
</p><p>
Some of his points from his presentation were that MVC is actually multiple design patterns, not just one. It combines three patterns, the Observer, Strategy and Compsite patterns.</p><p>
</p><p>
The Strategy pattern allows developers to loosely couple their applications. The Observer pattern acts like a listener. The Composition pattern refers to a has-a pattern where an object can be built with smaller objects. The controller works as the observer pattern.</p><p>
</p><p>
He then went into his Unity presentation. He did a demonstration with Reactor. Reactor uses the scaffold tag. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:44.000,markdown

How Apollo/Flex/Flash will help Java and ASPs,How-ApolloFlexFlash-will-help-Java-and-ASPs,"<p>Adobe is starting their marketing push for Apollo. From what I have read, Apollo is a combination of different technologies, including the new Flash player 9, PDF, Flex, HTML and disconnected as well as connected services. The last four years I have worked at companies that are Application Hosting Providers. In simple terms they have created web applications, and they lease the application to customers. Salesforce.com is a perfect example of an ASP. Not just because of their success as an ASP, but also because of the problems they have had as well. Since they provide a web based application, the customer depends on a maintained internet connection between their browser and the hosted application, not to mention that Salesforce.com's servers are up and running. Salesforce has had some service interruptions the have been widely reported in the news.</p><p>
</p><p>
Most ASPs have service license agreements with their customers that guarantee 98% or better uptime. The problem is if you try to access the application during the 2% downtime.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the great things about Macromedia Central was the concept of a ""Disconnected Application"". This is an application that makes use of an internet or network connection, but if the connection is broken, the application will still run. The application can take advantage of cached data, and once the connection is restored, the data can be synced between the server and the client.</p><p>
</p><p>
Since Central used Flash as the basis for the content, it is lightweight and easily deployable over the internet. Apollo is similar to Central since it does not depend on a live connection in order for application to run, but uses additional technologies such as PDF and HTML. </p><p>
</p><p>
One of the criticisms of Java is that it never really made it as a desktop environment for running applications, but it has become very popular as a portable server environment. Improvements have been made to Java on the desktop, but there are competing frameworks for GUI development, and incorrect perception (IMHO) that it is slow. James Gosling recently wrote on his blog about this, and admitted that one of the areas that SUN was working on was improving load times for J2SE.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the things I like about Flex is that you can build components in ColdFusion or Java that can be used as remote objects or web services inside of a Flex application. You can leverage your company's current Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as the backend for Flex.</p><p>
</p><p>
I believe since Apollo already uses technologies that are popular and universal on the desktop (Flash, PDF and HTML), and that run in all of the popular OSes (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X), it can become the front-end technology for Java. I would not be quick to dismiss Apollo. It deserves a good look as a solution for thin client based disconnected applications that can connect to your enterprise. I look forward to seeing examples from Adobe on their lab web site soon.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:45.000,markdown
Beware of hosting providers without server admins,Beware-of-hosting-providers-without-server-admins,"<p>I volunteer my time to maintain the website for my rowing club. I would list the domain for the site, but the site is down right now. I am in the process of trying to have the domain transfered.</p><p>
</p><p>
The hosting business uses a Linux server with LAMP installed to host all of their websites. When I first took over the club site, I was actually encouraged by the fact that they had options for PHP and MySQL. On Wednesday, I received an email from the hosting company that the club was past due by a month on the site, and that we owed them $115.00 for the year. The main problem with this is that they have never ever charged for the site before. The club is a non-profit organization, and can not afford to pay the hosting fee. </p><p>
</p><p>
So I sent them an email after the invoice, and told them to transfer the domain to me, and I would find another host.</p><p>
</p><p>
I never heard back.</p><p>
</p><p>
Then on Friday afternoon I decided to check the email for the site, and I could not authenticate with the IMAP server. So I decided to check the site, and was presented with a ""PAST DUE! login here, and pay us"" screen.</p><p>
</p><p>
At this point, I decided to call the hosting company. I was not able to reach the nice person who turned the site off, but I did get a lower level employee. That employee told me that an automated bot had turned the site off. He also informed me that they did not have an Linux administrator to manage the site, and that they were having service issues related to that fact.</p><p>
</p><p>
To compound matters, the administrative contact for the site is a board member of the club, but the hosting company listed their email address as the contact information for the administrative contact. So the entire process of transfering the domain has to go through a company that thinks we owe them money.</p><p>
</p><p>
So by the end of the day Friday, they finally responded to the first request from my registrar to begin the process of transfering the domain to my account. Since the site is a .org, it requires an authorization code from the original registrar. It was too late on Friday to get that code from original registrar, so the site has been down all weekend, an well into today.</p><p>
</p><p>
When the club set up the web site originally, they did not realize the importance of owning the domain name. In the mean time, the site has been down for four days.</p><p>
</p><p>
The moral of the story is to make sure you own the domain name. You can check and make sure the domain contact information is correct in the whois database. </p><p>
</p><p>
In the mean time, I have the code loaded to the new site. I am planning on using Raymond Camden's BlogCFC for the site blog. I am hosting the new site at <a href=""http://www.pridedata.com"">www.pridedata.com</a>, and they offer ColdFusion MX and PHP support.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:45.000,markdown

I bought my father a digital camera for XMas a couple of years ago. He has been bugging me lately for a way he can add Photos to my web site.</p><p>
</p><p>
I though about just creating a Flikr account, but I thought it would be easier if my father could just copy the folder of JPS to a folder on my website.</p><p>
</p><p>
So I created a ColdFusion based image browser. I even wrote a function in Java to resize the images to thumbnails once he uploads them to my site.</p><p>
</p><p>
I am planning to add a Spry based viewer next. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:46.000,markdown

I have never been a big fan of VB, but I know a lot of VB developers who felt they were left high and dry by Microsoft moving to .NET with all of the changes they made to make VB object oriented.</p><p>

VB for the Java platform is taking advantage of the multi-language features in Mustang, the next major release of Java. As most ColdFusion developers know, you can run multiple different programming languages on Java already. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:46.000,markdown

What does K.I.S.S. Stand For,What-does-KISS-Stand-For,"<p>When I finished college, I read an autobiography by the famed Aeronautical engineer, Clarence ""Kelly"" Johnson. He started the Skunk Works at Lockheed during WWII. The Skunk Works developed the P-80, America’s first jet fighter, as well as the U2 spy plane, the SR-71, and most recently the F-117 stealth fighter. Johnson believed when you are engineering, you should always subscribe to the K.I.S.S. principle. That stands for Keep It Simple Stupid!</p><p>
</p><p>
This is a motto I have always tried to subscribe too whenever it is possible. Sometimes it is not possible. A perfect example of that was the SR-71. There was nothing simple about the SR-71 to do as an engineer. Johnson told his engineers at the Skunk Works that he would give them $20 if they could find something simple to do on the SR-71. He retired with that same $20 bill. But if it was possible to something simply, he would do it that way.</p><p>
</p><p>
A better example of over-engineering recently was the Apple dual button mouse. Like many Mac users, I purchased a third party mouse with a right mouse button when I bought my Mac. When Apple released their own two-button mouse, I ran out and purchased it thinking that it would be way better than my third party USB mouse. Well I was wrong. The Apple mouse sucks! It used pressure sensitivity instead of an actual button to tell if you have clicked. Even worse, the software has a difficult time of telling where you clicked on the mouse. So sometimes when you click on the right side of the mouse, it thinks you clicked on the left side. It also has side squeeze buttons, so if you grip the mouse the wrong way, it open up exposure for Mac OS X 10.3+. Long story short, I am now using a Microsoft mouse.</p><p>
</p><p>
I recently ran into a situation where someone was trying to engineer a solution that was exceedingly complex, and did not necessarily solve the problem. I have found that sometimes it is a good idea to step back and take a look at your solution, and make sure it is accomplishing your goals without being exceedingly complex. Having peer reviews of you project is also a good idea. Sometimes a second set of eyes will point things that you did not take into account.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:47.000,markdown

How to invoke the ImageWatcher CFC,HowtoinvoketheImageWatcherCFC,"<p>Leif Wells asked if I would edit my previous <a href=""http://www.fekke.com/blog/index.cfm/2006/4/20/FileWatcherEventgatewayCFCforJpegthumbnailresizing"">blog post</a> on how to invoke the ImageWatcher CFC. The CFC is actually invoked by the Event Gateway. A new Gateway instance needs to be created in the ColdFusion Administrator. To create a new instance, click on the ""Event Gateways"" link, then on the ""Gateway Instances"". This will the ability to add or edit a new Gateway Instance. A new Instance requires a Gateway ID, Gateway type (DirectoryWatcher), CFC path (path to my ImageWatcher CFC), and a reference to the Configuration File.</p><p>
</p><p>
The configuration file tells ColdFusion which folder to watch, the interval, and which functions to call for the directory watcher. Here is an example of a config file;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">directory=c:<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""\\images"">\\images</A><br>
interval=10000<br>
extensions=jpg,jpeg<br>
addFunction=onAdd</div></p><p>

</p><p>
Our hosting provider uses LAMP to host their web sites, so everything is Apache, PHP and MySQL. I have worked with MySQL and Apache before, but not so much with PHP. Since I know enough to be dangerous with PHP, I decided to try using one of the open source packages for blogging, so we could use blog software on the web site.</p><p>
</p><p>
I decided to use <a href=""http://www.bblog.com/"">bBlog</a> for our blog. One of the things I noticed was how easy it was to install the different php projects that I came across. Most of these packages make it very easy to install on a LAMP site just using FTP and an HTML based wizard.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:48.000,markdown
Boot Camp and VMWare both available for Intel Macs,Boot-Camp-and-VMWare-both-available-for-Intel-Macs,"<p>When Apple first announced the MacBook Pro earlier this year, I thought about ordering one then, but decided against buying one for several reasons. One is that I just bought a PowerMac last year before the announcement. Another reason is I use my current laptop for my DBA work, and SQL Server is my primary database. A couple of weeks ago someone came out with a way to dual boot a Mac with Windows. Then yesterday Apple announced the beta of Boot Camp which essentially does the same thing.</p><p>
</p><p>
This is all good news, but What I really need to be able to do is use the Mac OS for my development, and run my SQL code on Windows at the same time on the same machine. Ideally having an Windows image on a Mac so I can have Windows sandboxed as much as possible.</p><p>

Today Parellels announced the beta of <a href=""http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/"">Parallels Workstation 2.1</a>.

ColdFusion MX 6.1 SOAP Client WSDL url is case sensitive,ColdFusionMX61SOAPClientWSDLurliscasesensitive,"<p>A developer where I work experienced a problem with two ColdFusion MX servers trying to make web service calls to each server. One of the CFMX servers was running version 6.1, and the other was running 7.0.1. The code for calling the web service on both servers was identical. The web service call looked like this; <div class=""code"">myWSObj = createObject(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""webservice""</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""http://myserver.com/com/myserver/soapconnector.cfc?wsdl"">http://myserver.com/com/myserver/soapconnector.cfc?wsdl</A>""</FONT>);</div></p><p>
</p><p>
When he went to run the call, ColdFusion MX 6.1 threw an error, but 7.0.1 did not throw an error at all.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">[]coldfusion.jsp.CompilationFailedException: Errors reported by Java compiler: Found 1 semantic error compiling <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""E:/JRun4/servers/Instance19a/cfusion-ear/cfusion-war/WEB-INF/cfusion/stubs/WS-14748293807/com/myserver/SoapconnectorCfcSoapBindingStub.java""</FONT>: 10. public class SoapconnectorCfcSoapBindingStub extends org.apache.axis.client.Stub implements com.myserver.Soapconnector { &lt;-------------&gt; *** Error: Type com/myserver/Soapconnector was not found.</div></p><p>
</p><p>
The problem was being caused from the fact that CFC 'soapConnector.cfc' was camel cased in the file system. In CFMX 6.1 the path of the wsdl being passed in your code IS CASE SENSITIVE.</p><p>
</p><p>
The fix if you are using CFMX 6.1 is to make sure the path you are using is correctly cased as it is on the file server.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:49.000,markdown

Congratulations to Apple for turning 30,Congratulations-to-Apple-for-turning-30,"<p>I was just thinking back to my earliest experiences with Apple computers. When I was child, my elementary school has a lab of Apple II's. I started programming with the Apple Basic that WOZ had added to the ROMs on the Apple II. From that point on I was hooked to personal computing. Since 1986 I have owned six different Apple computers, five of them were Macintosh's including the G5 I use as my home computer now.</p><p>
</p><p>
In the 90s when I was working in the print publishing industry, I really started to cut my teeth scripting with AppleScript.</p><p>

In the 30 year history of Apple Computer, I have watched the company go from a media loved company, to a media hated company, back to a media loved company.</p><p>
</p><p>
My attitude towards the company has not changed. I am a loyal customer, I love their products, yet they still piss me off from time to time. I look forward to seeing the products they produce over the next 30 years.</p><p>

Congratulations to Apple for making it this far.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:49.000,markdown

.NET being ported to Mac OS X?,DOTNETbeingportedtoMacOSX,"<p>I recently read that Microsoft is thinking about porting .NET to Mac OS X. As a developer, I think this would be awesome if they did. I use .NET at work now when I can not use ColdFusion. James Gosling, the inventor of Java, recently criticized .net and some other non-java technologies in a speech he gave. One of his criticisms about .NET is that Microsoft missed an opportunity by not being trully cross-platform.</p><p>
</p><p>
The Mono project has already crossed some these cross platform issues by supporting Linux and the Mac OS.</p><p>
</p><p>
Microsoft would have some technical hurdles to overcome to port .NET to the Mac. One of those would be their reliance on parts of the framework that use COM still. Much of that has been fixed now in .NET 2.0. Another issue would be porting Windows Forms so that it maintains the Mac look and feel. But I think it can be done.</p><p>
</p><p>
As a Mac developer and a .NET developer, I hope Microsofts does port .NET to the Mac. This is the one area where Java has shined over .NET is cross platform development.</p><p>
</p><p>
Now if we could convince Microsoft to port .NET to Linux. I am not holding my breath for that one.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:49.000,markdown
Making Soap based web service calls with Ajax,Making-Soap-based-web-service-calls-with-Ajax,"<p>I have been preparing a presentation for my local user group on Ajax. Part of my presentation will be on REST vs. SOAP based RPC calls. One of the arguments against using SOAP based web service calls is that it is too hard to make SOAP calls using the XMLHTTPRequest object. I have not found this to be the case. The trick to making SOAP calls with XMLHTTPRequest object is setting the right request headers before making the call. SOAP calls should also be made as a post rather than a get. Here is an example below;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">xmlhttp.open(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""POST""</FONT>,url,true);<br><FONT COLOR=GRAY><I></p><p>
// set header for valid XML document</I></FONT></p><p>
xmlhttp.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml; charset=utf-8');<br><FONT COLOR=GRAY><I></p><p>
// Set the SOAPAction header, ColdFusion will look for the SOAPAction header.</I></FONT></p><p>

"Google Finance, Flash and AJAX",Google-Finance-Flash-and-AJAX,"<p>I have been reading a lot of negative comments today about the new Google Finance site that Google added today. I guess Google is starting to loose some of their mind share.</p><p>
</p><p>
I like Google Finance so far, but mostly because of the technologies that they are using to implement this new site. Google Finance makes heavy use of Flash widgets and AJAX. The Stock chart is linked to the headlines, so if you select a sudden drop in the share price, the headlines change to correspond to the dates of the drop. Very cool!</p><p>
</p><p>
I have been giving Google a hard time about some of their business decisions, but I think they deserve credit for their engineering. It is nice to see that Google is using Flash.</p><p>

Cffile file error shows wrong attribute as cause,Cffile-file-error-shows-wrong-attribute-as-cause,"<p>One of the developers I work with ran into a problem yesterday with the cffile tag that seems to be too common with ColdFusion MX 6.1. The tag threw an error saying that the  source attribute did not have a valid path. We double checked the source, and it actually had a valid path. </p><p>
</p><p>
We then checked the destination attribute, and it did have an incorrect path assigned. We fixed the path for the destination, and the page is working fine again. The is one of my main beefs with ColdFusion MX. As descriptive as the errors usually are, many times the wrong kind of error is displayed, or the wrong template is listed as the source of the error along with the wrong line number.</p><p>

I love ColdFusion MX, but I wish Adobe would fix these problems because these were not problems in ColdFusion 5 and earlier.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:49.000,markdown

My Oscar picks for this weekend,Oscarpicks2006,"<p>The Oscars are this weekend, and I thought I would make my Oscar picks for this year and give my explanation as to why the academy will pick a nominee. Best Motion Picture of the Year:</p><p>
Brokeback Mountain will when best picture. The academy will not be able to resist giving an Oscar to a movie about gay cowboys. I have not seen this one yet, but I doubt I will since that South Park episode about the independant film festival. In that episode, all independant films were about gay cowboys.</p><p>
</p><p>
Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role:</p><p>
Philip Seymour Hoffman will win for Capote. Hoffman is an Oscar fav, but I hope it goes to Terrence Howard for Hustle in Flow. His performances in Crash and Hustle and Flow and Crash were incredible.</p><p>
</p><p>
Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role:</p><p>
Dame Judi Dench will win for Mrs. Henderson Presents. She is always an Oscar fav.</p><p>

Frances McDormand will win for North Country. McDormand is always a Oscar fav, plus she is married toa Coen brother, and that does not hurt.</p><p>

Best Achievement in Directing:</p><p>
Ang Lee will win for Brokeback Mountain. And Lee will be redeimed for making The Incedible Hulk, even though I liked that movie.</p><p>

Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published:</p><p>
Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana will win for Brokeback Mountain. Larry McMurtry has penned many of the great screenplay for the last 40 years. The Academy loves him. I am personally partial to Lonesome Dove and Hud.</p><p>
</p><p>
Best Achievement in Cinematography:</p><p>
Rodrigo Prieto will win for Brokeback Mountain. This movie was shot in Canada, and it is impossible to make Canada look bad on film.</p><p>
</p><p>

I just downloaded the NetBeans 5.0 IDE from <a href=""http://www.netbeans.org"">Netbeans.org</a>. I wrote a application that calls and displays the results of the web service.</p><p>
</p><p>
I did have to add an additional library for the web service call on my Mac for the application to run on both Windows and the Mac. I also set the look and feel so it would look like a Windows application on the PC, and like a Mac app on the Mac.</p><p>

New design for my Blog,NewdesignformyBlog,"<p>I decided to redesign my blog last night. I am using Aura from Leorex and the Aura skin that Joe Rinehart created for Aura. The nice thing about Aura is that they provide a Photoshop template to redesign the skin very easily. I personally feel it looks better than my last design, and it uses CSS positioning for the layout.</p><p>
</p><p>
I did run into some problems initially with the Javascript popup window functionality for the blog editor. I think it has to do with the version of BlogCFC I am using and the version of the Aura skin that Joe provided. I am using BlogCFC 3.5.</p><p>
</p><p>

SQL Server 2005 Integration Services training,SQLServer2005IntegrationServicestraining,"<p>I have been at SQL Server 2005 Integration Services training for the last two days, and I have to say it has been an eye opener. The class is being taught by <a href=""http://www.whiteknighttechnology.com/cs/blogs/brian_knight/"">Brian Knight</a></p><p>
 of Idea Integration. Brian runs the local SQL Server users group, and has co-authored a book on SSIS. Integration Services is the replacement for Sql Server’s DTS (Data Transformation Services) packages. It provides a graphical tool for programming data integrations into and out of SQL Server. DTS was already fast before SSIS for importing and exporting data, but it was limited in what you could do without doing a lot of activex scripting. At my current job, we use ColdFusion to do our file moving, ftp and encryption. We presently reserve DTS for bulk transformations on the database server.</p><p>
</p><p>
All of the things that we could not do in DTS can be done now with Integration Services. SSIS can also iterate through files in a directory though containers. XML support in SQL Server 2000 was non-existent, but the support is much better in SSIS. If you do not have an XSD file for your XML file, SSIS will generate one for you.</p><p>
</p><p>
SSIS also has improved scripting capability, and comes with a new expression language for evaluating system and user variables.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">@[User::varConfigString] == @[System::PackageName]</div></p><p>
</p><p>
If you use SQL Server 2005 and have to integrate with different data sources, SSIS is comes included with SQL Server. It is a cheap alternative to other ETL solutions such as CastIron, WebMethods and EAI.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:51.000,markdown
Don't buy Intel based Mac if you are a graphics professional,DontbuyIntelbasedMac,"<p>A firend of mine is a graphics professional, and he asked me if he should get a Intel based iMac for his job. I told him absolutely not!</p><p>
</p><p>
Alright, I know what you are saying. ""David, you are a mac guy, how can you tell a graphic professional not to buy a mac."" Here is why, Adobe. Adobe is not planning on leasing any of their CS apps as dual binary until CS3. Typically, new versions of Adobe apps are released every 18-24 months. CS2 was just released about 6 months ago, so it will propably be late 2007 before Adobe has CS3 ready.</p><p>
</p><p>
This means that Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign would have to run in emulation on an Intel based Mac. It is certainly faster than running 68K code in emulation on a PowerPC, but the experience would suck.</p><p>
</p><p>
So with that all being said, you can buy a mac for these apps as long as it is a PowerPC based Mac. I would suggest buying a PowerMac G5 if you need to run CS2.</p><p>
</p><p>
If you are using Motion graphics such as Apple Motion or Final Cut Pro, Apple is supposed to be coming out with dual binaries for these apps in March. The wait will not be as long for Apple's apps. Quark Inc. supposedly has a beta of Xpress for the Intel Mac.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:51.000,markdown

Using .NET CLR code on SQL Server 2005,UsingNETCLRcodeonSQLServer2005,"<p>I went to a presentation last night at the Jacksonville SQL Server user group on using .NET CLR code in SQL Server 2005. One of the neat features in SQL Server 2005 is the ability to write user defined functions, aggregate functions and stored procedures in .NET code. The examples they used included doing triple DES encryption and spherical trigonometry to calculate distances between latitude and longitude in SQL queries.</p><p>
</p><p>
They accomplised this by writting functions in C# assemblies, and adding those assemblies to the SQL Server.</p><p>
</p><p>
The bottom line is there are some things that are faster to do in the CLR than in T-SQL, and some things that are faster to do in T-SQL than in the CLR. </p><p>

Complex math and string functions would most likely be faster in the CLR, but set based computing would be faster in transact.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:51.000,markdown
ColdFusion MX and .NET mashup,ColdFusionMXandNETmashup,"<p>I am a firm believer in not re-inventing the wheel. My company has a text parser that was written in ColdFusion. It typically processes one document. I just finished a project where I had to process 200,000 documents. The kicker was almost all of these documents where Microsoft Word files. I needed to write an application that could read Word files and convert them to text files. I used the COM interop features built into .NET 2.0 to accomplish this task.</p><p>
</p><p>
I also wanted to have a way to monitor the progress of this conversion. I used Windows forms and the progress bar component to do this part.</p><p>
</p><p>
I kept the parsing functions in ColdFusion, and passed the text to a ColdFusion SOAP web service.</p><p>

The end result was able to come up with a solution in a day without having to rewrite all of the functionality in C# or Java.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:51.000,markdown

DOM vs. SAX XML parsers,DOM-vs-SAX-XML-parsers,"<p>I was recently told by a co-worker that you should never use DOM based XML parsers to load XML data into a application or database.</p><p>
</p><p>
DOM is extremely bad in JAVA for processing large XML documents, mainly because it has to load the entire document into memory. We use JRun which by default has a maximum of 512 megabytes of memory. If you have a XML file that is several hundred megabytes in size, JRun will not be able to load the whole document into memory. SAX or the Simple API for XML processing does a much better job at processing large XML files. The reason for this is you can load portions of the XML file into a buffer, extract the information you need, and process the rest of the file. Since you are you are only loading a portion of the file at a time, it does not require as much memory.</p><p>
</p><p>
So why would anyone ever use DOM based parsers for processing XML. While it is true that DOM does poor job at handling large XML documents, it is much easier to develop for DOM than SAX. DOM based parsers are more elegant and have an easier learning curve than SAX. Most XML files that developers run into are small enough that they can be handled with a DOM based parser.</p><p>
</p><p>
SAX is based on an event model that raises events when tags are recognized in the buffer. It is nowhere as elegant as a real XML API.</p><p>
</p><p>
ColdFusion MX uses a DOM based parser for processing XML. It allows the developer to treat the XML as tree structure and to use xpath for searching for specific nodes.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:52.000,markdown

Steve Gibson alleges that WMF exploit was Intentional,SteveGibsonallegesthatWMFexploitwasIntentional,"<p>This story is already on Digg and Slashdot, but I thought I would throw my two cents on as well.

Debugging web service calls with a TCP monitor,Debugging-web-service-calls-with-a-TCP-monitor,"<p>I just discovered a really neat tool for debugging web services. There is a sniffer application that will reroute TCP requests that come with every version of ColdFusion MX. In the JRun_Root\bin directory or ColdFusionMX_Root\runtime\bin their is a Java application called sniffer.exe. This will allow you to monitor all tcp requests in an unused port, such as 8600 or 8800, and reroute the request to a legitimate port such as 80.</p><p>

I used this to look at a http post request that someone was using to call a SOAP based web service.</p><p>

Yesterday I tried to avoid the arguments for or against ColdFusion as a Object Oriented language. Sean points out some of the differences between C++ and Smalltalk as it pertains to method overloading.</p><p>
</p><p>
You can get into a real religous argument about one language over another. I personally consider ColdFusion to be an Object Oriented language since the release of ColdFusion MX. You can do most of the things you can do in other Object Oriented languages i.e. Encapsulation, Persistence, Composition, Inheritance and Polymorphism.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the points I was trying to make is that by learning CFCs, you can springboard into other languages with very little effort. All of the same concepts you learn with CFCs can be applied to languages such as Java, C#, ActionScript, C++ and Smalltalk.</p><p>
</p><p>
Alan Kay is credited with coining the term ""Object Oriented"" and for authoring SmallTalk. I read an interview with him recently, and he said that if he had it all to do over again he would not have used the term ""Object Oriented"", he would have used ""Message Oriented"". One of the real powerful features of Object Oriented development is the ability of objects to talk to each other.</p><p>

CFCs ease adoption of C#,CFCs-ease-adoption-of-CSharp,"<p>I have finished up some projects recently developing C# windows form based applications. When .NET was first released in beta, I took a look at it and joined a C# User Group, but I never developed any applications. About that same time, Macromedia released a beta of ColdFusion MX with these new things called components. I looked at the syntax and observed that they were really class based objects. That was enough to keep me busy for the next couple of years.</p><p>
</p><p>
My next job was working at a company that needed to rearchitect a web application where the business logic needed to be reused throughout several front ends web sites. They were looking at using Custom Tags. I evangilized using CFCs instead because that seemed to be a much better way to implement backend reuse. They also worked better as a BlackBox. Custom Tags can arbitralily pull values from any scope and place values back into those scopes or the caller scope. Custom Tags do not offer true encapsulation.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have had a lot of religous arguments with other developers about whether ColdFusion is truly Object Oriented language now. It is true that CFCs do not offer method overloading and a true way of implementing interfaces, but you can still do most of what you would be able to do with Java or other Object Oriented languages.</p><p>
</p><p>
The end result was I learned a lot about writing Object Oriented code and Object Oriented design patterns.</p><p>
</p><p>
When I started writing these new programs in C# I had not looked at the language or .NET in about three years. I was able to write these programs with little or no effort mainly to do with the fact that I was familiar with the concepts of Object Oriented development from working with CFCs. </p><p>
</p><p>
My biggest learning curve came from learning the .NET API. I had some experience working with ADO from ASP 3.0. Microsoft has made some nice enhancements to ADO for .NET 2.0. </p><p>
</p><p>
I am usually the first person to criticize Microsoft, but they have some very nice development tools and a very nice framework now. I am still not sold on ASP.NET.</p><p>

Cast Iron Class notes,Cast-Iron-Class-notes,"<p>I finished my training yesterday on the Cast Iron Application router. It is composed of two pieces of software, one is a Java based Studio application for creating orchestrations. The other is a web based management console.

Once you finish the design, you can push them to a router for testing.</p><p>

Most of the actual debuging occurs on the Web based console. You can schedule integrations on the web console as well as generate WSDL files for hosted web services, and change parameters for your integrations.</p><p>

SAP ABAP will not generate Proxy to ColdFusion SOAP Web Service,SAPABAPwillnotgenerateProxytoColdFusionSOAPWebService,"<p>We have a partner who is using SAP and ABAP to consume web services. We are trying to provide a ColdFusion Web Service that they can call with ABAP.</p><p>

They get the following error when they try to generate the proxy;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">System response<br></p><p>
<br></p><p>
<br></p><p>
ABAP proxy generation expects that all directly and indirectly referenced<br></p><p>

this WSDL and the system displays an error message.<br></p><p>

XMLSearch() comments added to Livedocs,XMLSearch()-comments-added-to-Livedocs,<p>Macromedia has posted mine and Steven Erat's comments onto <a href=""http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/7/htmldocs/00000672.htm"">livedocs</a> for xmlsearch about the NoNameSpace issue. </p>,2011-01-18 03:24:54.000,markdown
XMLSearch is not broken,XMLSearch-is-not-broken,"<p>I was wrong. XMLSearch is not broken. Steven Erat at Talking Tree made a post about this issue on his <a href=""http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/"">blog</a>. </p><p>
</p><p>
The issue has to do with setting a namespace without using a prefix qualifier. Here is an example from Steven's blog;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;BackgroundReports xmlns=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""http://ns.r-xml.org/2004-08-02"">http://ns.r-xml.org/2004-08-02</A>""</FONT> ....&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Since the xml sets a namespace without the qualifier, no namespace gets set at all. Because of this, the xPath has to be explicit;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">/:BackgroundReports/:ProviderReferenceId/:IdValue</div></p><p>
</p><p>
By placing the colons after the forward slashes, you are telling the search that the elements are in a no-name namespace. This should return the results you are looking for in your xml.</p><p>
</p><p>
Thank you Steven Erat for pointing out what was actually happening. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:54.000,markdown

XMLSearch() function still broken in ColdFusion 7.0.1,XMLSearchFunctionstillbrokeninColdFusion701,"<p>I really wish Macromedia and the ColdFusion team would fix their bugs! I was a beta tester for Blackstone, and I hoped that Macromedia would have fixed the XMLSearch() before CFMX 7 was released.</p><p>

I just tested CFMX 7.0.1 to see if this was fixed, and it is still broken. I am happy that there is a Macintosh installer now, but this has been an issue all the way back in CFMX 6.</p><p>
</p><p>
XMLSearch() works fine until you set a XmlNsURI anywhere in the XML document. You can test this by adding a xmlns=""anyURLHere"" name attribute in any tag in your XML file. Once this is set, XMLSearch() breaks. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:54.000,markdown

Dell selling AMD processors?,Dell-selling-AMD-processors,"<p>I saw a CNET article today that Dell was selling some individual AMD processors, as if Dell was testing the waters. They still do not sell PCs with AMD processors, but they may be looking to change that now. My company only bought Dell computers for the longest time. Recently, we have started breaking away from that practice. Some of people at my company use Macs. We also have some higher end laptops and servers using AMD processors.</p><p>
</p><p>
I think since Dell is seeing a slowdown in their business, they are taking a second look at AMD processors. AMD always seems to win the speed tests in the desktop and x86 based servers. Even Sun is using AMD processors in their x86 servers.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:54.000,markdown
Sony installing RootKit on PCs with some of their music CDs,Sony-installing-RootKit-on-some-of-their-music-CDs,"<p>I heard this weekend that Sony hired a company to develop a rootKit to be installed on the computer of the person listening to its CDs. If you are not familiar with rootKits, they alter the default functionality of an users operating system. This is very common behavior in spyware and malware. Apparently, they have been selling these CDs from the beginning of the year.</p><p>
</p><p>
This is not the type of behavior I would expect from a major corporation like Sony, more like from a black hat hacker. I own a lot of sony products, but I do think I will be buying any of their music CDs any time soon.</p><p>

The CDs should be labeled with some sort of label advertising that they have copy protection. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:54.000,markdown

Is Aperture a PhotoShop killer?,IsApertureaPhotoShopkiller,"<p>Apple just announced its ""Professional"" image editing program, Aperture. It is designed for professional image editing. So how does it compare to PhotoShop? The answer is it is very lame compared to PhotoShop. </p><p>
</p><p>
Aperture does not allow you to do any actual retouching, even though Apple says you can in their marketing. There are no cloning or paint tools. The only editing that Aperture lets you do is make tonal and color changes in a nondestructive way. Photoshop has allowed for this for over seven years now.</p><p>
</p><p>
The one thing that Aperture lets you do that is pretty cool is that it uses Apple's Core Image API. The Core Image API is Apple's underlying image processing using the Quartz imaging engine. Adobe has always used their own engine for image processing. This may give Apple some speed advantages.</p><p>
</p><p>
The price tag is steep at $499.00 US. For 100 bucks more, I would just buy a copy of PhotoShop. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:55.000,markdown

The data services allow for flagless updates to a database server. You can use DAO objects to update an Array of objects.</p><p>

because this is the kind of development I do everyday. He talked a lot about about messaging based systems for integrating enterprise data. The Two big ones are JMS and SOAP. </p><p>
</p><p>
Other were also mentioned like of the microsoft variety. The importance of making sure your integration code is ""loosely coupled"" was also brought up in the presentation.</p><p>
</p><p>
He also mentioned how security is becoming a bigger factor, like adding the ability to use SOAP headers in the request and responce to a Web Service.</p><p>
</p><p>
Some of the other ways organizations exange data is by ftping or httping flat files and xml files. Occasionally some use a shared database, but this is uncommon because of differences of database schemas.</p><p>
</p><p>
There is a function on cflib called listFix() for fixing inproperly formated csv files. </p><p>

So by using the HAVING clause, you can check for a count greater than one on the column that has been duplicated using the COUNT() aggregate function. You can then filter out the records you want to keep by using the MIN() aggregate function on the column that is truly unique. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:57.000,markdown

Apache and ColdFusion MX 7.0.1 on Mac OS X 10.4,Apache-and-ColdFusion-MX-701-on-Mac-OS-X-104,"<p>A couple of little hangups when I tried to install ColdFusion MX 7.0.1 on my Mac. I set it up for Apache. I embarrased to say that I have never used Jrun or ColdFusion with Apache on Mac OS X. I always use the built in web server that comes with CF, but I wanted to use Apache this time.</p><p>
</p><p>
When installing ColdFusion, the installer will ask where the web root for your web server is located. It needs this to know where to install the cfide directory. On Mac OS X 10.4 the web root is located in /Library/Webserver/Documents/ folder. You can also install it in the sites folder in the User directory for your user. </p>",2011-01-18 03:24:57.000,markdown

CFC function calls in pound signs,CFC-function-calls-in-pound-signs,"<p>I try to write as little code as I can get away with. Because of this, I make functions calls like this in my cfoutput tags.</p><p>

#myString#<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>

What happens is if the function does not have output=""no"" it defaults to true. So just like in a regular cfm page, the white space is added to the function. If you set the output=""no"", no white space will appear. The result will look like this;</p><p>

IE 10 years old and Open Standards,IE10yearsoldandOpenStandards,"<p>I have been writting HTML before Netscape released their first browser. I was very exited when the first Netscape browsers came out because the used the table tag. </p><p>
</p><p>
This marks the tenth aniversary of the first Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft was late to the game, but they worked very hard to make it a better browser than the netscape browser. Many of the web developers I worked with gave up writting their code so it would work with both browsers. IE quickly surpassed Netscape as the most common browser.</p><p>
</p><p>
I certainly started to write my code so that it would correctly on IE first, and I would check that it worked on other browsers and operating systems.</p><p>
</p><p>
I jumped on the IE bandwagon for a couple of reasons. That was because they made it easy for developers to write for their browsers, and they supported open standards.</p><p>
</p><p>
With that, I would like to say, ""What have you done for me lately?"" It is almost like Microsoft has droped the ball. I still write my code so it will run on IE browsers, but I also make sure it runs in Mozila and Safari. I also test my HTML on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X computers. I believe that IE still holds around 90 percent market share.</p><p>
</p><p>
Hopefully Microsoft will catch up and embrace open standards again, but I am not holding my breath.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:57.000,markdown

Bulk transformations in SQL Server,BulktransformationsinSQLServer,"<p>One of the mistakes I have seen developers make is not using bulk transaformations in SQL. It does not matter if you use MS SQL Server, Oracle, DB2 or MySQL, all of the RDBMS's provide developers a way to perform bulk transformations of data.</p><p>
</p><p>
One of the powerful things about SQL is that you can update or insert thousands or millions of records with one SQl Statement. Here is a simple example. Lets say I have a thousand records in a table that have a bit column to determine if a record is active. I can set every record of that table to inactive with two lines of SQL.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">UPDATE myTable<br></p><p>
SET Active = 0;<br></p><p>
GO</div></p><p>
</p><p>
If I only want to set records in my table that have a certain value in another column to inactive, I can do that as well with a few lines of SQL.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">UPDATE myTable<br></p><p>
SET active = 0<br></p><p>
WHERE State = 'CA';<br></p><p>
GO</div></p><p>
</p><p>
If I need to populate all of the records of one table from another table, I can do that with one SQL statement as well;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">INSERT INTO myTable (firstName, Lastname, addressLine, City, State, Zip)<br></p><p>
SELECT fName, lName, Address1, City, StateProvince, ZipCode<br></p><p>
FROM impTempTable;<br></p><p>
GO</div></p>",2011-01-18 03:24:58.000,markdown
Using SOAP Request Headers in CFMX 6.1,UsingSOAPRequestHeadersinCFMX61,"<p>One of the developers I work with recently had a problem trying to make Web Service calls to a SOAP based Web method that requires Request Headers. I ran into the same problem about a year ago using CFMX 6.1. Request and response headers for web services are now built into CFMX 7. It is possible to get CFMX 6.1 to send request headers. Here is how you can do it with CFMX 6.1. The first thing you will have to do is make sure CFMX is patched to at least the 6.1 updater (6,1,0,83762) or the hf53566_61.jar hot fix. This patch will cause problems with trying to use cfdump to output the cfcatch variable, but there is also a patch for that as well.</p><p>
</p><p>
You will need to use the createObject function to create a web service object instead of using cfinvoke to be able to use the request header.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset WSObj = createObject(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""webservice""</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""https://www.somecompany.com/services/somews.asmx?wsdl"">https://www.somecompany.com/services/somews.asmx?wsdl</A>""</FONT>) /&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Request headers are usually in the form of a XML object. You can use the CFMX's built features to create the xml object.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset doc = XMLNew() /&gt;</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset doc.Authentication = XmlElemNew(doc, <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""https://www.somecompany.com/services/"">https://www.somecompany.com/services/</A> ""</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""Authentication""</FONT>) /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset doc.Authentication.username = XmlElemNew(doc, <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""username""</FONT>) /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset doc.Authentication.username.XmlText = <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""myUsername""</FONT> /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset doc.Authentication.password = XmlElemNew(doc, <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""password""</FONT>) /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset doc.Authentication.password.XmlText = <FONT COLOR=BLUE>""myPassword""</FONT> /&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
The resulting XML looks like this when serialized;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=GREEN>&lt;Authentication&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;username&gt;</FONT>myUsername<FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;/username&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;password&gt;</FONT>myPassword<FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;/password&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=GREEN>&lt;/Authentication&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
The object that is passed to to the request header method requires the use of some java, but it is very simple. The first thing that needs to happen is to turn the ColdFusion XML Object into something that Java will understand. There is a function built into every ColdFusion XML object that returns a Java based XML object.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset jXMLdoc = doc.getDocumentElement() /&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Once you have the java based XML object, you will need to create a SOAPHeaderElement java object that will be passed into the web service object.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset headerElement = createObject(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""java""</FONT>,<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""org.apache.axis.message.SOAPHeaderElement""</FONT>) /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset headerElement.init(jXMLdoc) /&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset WSObj.setHeader(headerElement) /&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Now that the request header has been set in the web service object, it is safe to call the methods that require that request header.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset responseValue = WSObj.makeWSCall() /&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
I plan on creating a web service on my web site that use request and responce headers. Thanks to Tom Jordahl and Damon Cooper who showed me how to get this to work in ColdFusion 6.1.</p><p>
</p><p>
ColdFusion MX 7 handles this now quite well by using addSOAPRequestHeader() function. There is no longer a need to call the underlying java to make these calls.</p>",2011-01-18 03:24:58.000,markdown
isNumeric function in MS T-SQL,isNumericfunctioninMSTSQL,"<p>I do a lot of data conversions with my current job. I use a lot string and date function that are provided in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 in order to validate column when doing my bulk inserts and updates. I came across one today that is in the books online, but I did not realize it was there.</p><p>
</p><p>
I use ColdFusion functions all the time like isDate and isNumeric to check variables for proper type. Here is an example of where these functions can be used in bulk inserts.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">USE myFakeDB;<br>
GO<br>

SELECT CASE isNumeric(CustomerNumber)<br>

XHTML and CSS validation,XHTMLandCSSvalidation,"<p>I just went through the process of making sure my site is XHTML 1.1 and CSS compliant. The W3C.org site has several validators that will inspect your code to make sure it is compliant. They will show line by line where there are problems in your code.</p><p>
</p><p>
Bottom line is that my site had a lot of compliance issues. I got them fixed, but here are some of the gotchas I ran into cleaning up my design.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;br&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Since XHTML is a subset of XML, it follows all of the rules of having proper XML formating. I had a lot of breaking returns. Single tags require that you have a slash at the end, or a closing tag. Breaking returns should look like this;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;br /&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
It is also common to have paragraph returns in a single tag, but this is not proper either. Your paragraphs should be enclosed in beginning and end tags.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;p&gt;</FONT><br>
Your paragraph here.<br>
<FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;/p&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
For the 1.1 compliance you need to adhere to strict XHTML. Targets attributes are not allowed in href anchor tags. I have used target=""_blank"" to open up new windows, but I have had to replace them with the following syntax;</p><p>
</p><p>

"Google Talk IM Client is out, and why this is really important",GoogleTalkIsOutNow,"<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/talk/"" target=""_blank"">Google Talk</a> was released today. This is HUGE! AOL, YAHOO and MSN have dominated the IM space for years. I have heard from users that if Google released an IM client, they would use it over AIM or MSN messenger.</p><p>
</p><p>
That being said, what is really important about this is that Google Talk uses Jabber. Jabber is an open standard for Instant Messaging. If Google Talk takes off, it will acheive something that corporate IT departments have wished for for years, a standard IM protocol. Linux and Mac users can use this service with their IM clients because it is uses Jabber. I was able to sign up last night using my iChat AV client because Jabber is a supported protocol.</p><p>
</p><p>
ColdFusion Event Gateways also supports the Jabber protocol. Expect to see a lot of application using this Google Client. I know I will be writting some in the near future.</p>",2011-01-18 03:25:00.000,markdown

Host header files and other Dev annoyances,HostheaderfilesDevAnnoyances,"<p>I recently came across the following error testing a web service call using ColdFusion MX.</p><p>
</p><p>
<em>Error Could not generate stub objects for web service invocation.</em></p><p>
</p><p>
It was followed by a name and the following message; <em>java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect It is recommended that you use a web browser to retrieve and examine the requested WSDL document for correctness. If the requested WSDL document can't be retrieved or it is dynamically generated, it is likely that the target web service has programming errors.</em></p><p>
</p><p>
Basically what this means is that the application server can not connect to the server hosting the web service or the wsdl file.</p><p>
</p><p>
The reason for this error was caused by a host header file that caused a conflict on the application server and the DNS server. Swapping out the domain name with the actual IP address can fix this sometimes.</p>",2011-01-18 03:25:00.000,markdown

Blue Ray vs. HDDVD: Why Sony will lose,SonyWillLoseHDDVDWar,"<p>This definitely will follow my own personal opinion on technology. If you have been living on another planet for the last year, you might have heard that there is a format war ala VHS vs. Betamax.</p><p>
</p><p>
The two competing standards are a high def format from Toshiba and Sony's Blue Ray DVD. Toshiba's format, HD DVD, can store 15 gigabyte's on a layer while Sony's Blue Ray will store 25 gigabytes on a layer. Blue Ray also allows your DVD interactive content to be programmed with Java. Blue Ray also has better content protection that will allow consumers to copy Blue Ray content to other types of players. The only negative I have seen so far is that the media for Blue Ray is easier to scratch, but a solution has been found for that already.</p><p>
</p><p>
With all of that being said, Sony will lose. Every new format that Sony has come out with has been a Sony only format. Betamax was a Sony format, and it failed. Betamax is still used at television studios because the quality is much higher than VHS.</p><p>
</p><p>
I hope I am wrong. Sony has gotten a few studios to come to their side along with a few prominent Computer companies. Unfortunately, consumers usually buy the cheaper technology. As a developer, it would be nice to see a format that uses Java win.</p><p>
</p><p>
Good Luck Sony.</p>",2011-01-18 03:25:00.000,markdown

Mac OS X on x86,MacOSXOnIntelvmware,"<p>I have been reading a couple of articles about Mac OS X running on x86 processors as a vmware disk image. If you have been living hole in the ground for the last couple of months, you might have heard that Apple is switching to Intel processors.</p><p>
</p><p>
The development machines that shipped have the installer disk, and so people have managed to install Mac OS X without the machine level copy protection. My personal opinion about the move to Intel is that is about time. </p><p>
</p><p>
As far as Apple selling the Mac OS for any pc, I think that is a bad idea. Apple is a hardware company, and besides that it is a lot easier to develope an operating system if you also make the hardware, rather than trying to make the Mac OS compatible with every piece of hardware out there.</p><p>

Amazon Web Services funkiness with BlueDragon.NET,AmazonWebServicesOnBDNET,"<p>I have been playing around with BlueDragon.NET with one of the older applications I have that uses Web Services. If you have not looked at the Amazon Web Service, you really should because it is a good example of how Web Services should work.</p><p>
</p><p>
Unlike the Google web Services, you only pass one parameter into the web method, and only one parameter is passed back. Both are actually simple SOAP objects that are defined in the WSDL file. The chief difference I am finding with ColdFusion MX and Blue Dragon is that ColdFusion treats the object returned as a Java Object, and BD treats the object as a series of structures and arrays. Here is an example of some test code I wrote. Try running it in both ColdFusion and BD, and see the results.</p><p>

Model Glue Framework much faster on BlueDragon.NET,ModelGlueFasterOnBDNET,"<p>I am a big fan of all of the major ColdFusion frameworks. They all support Model View Controller. Joe Reinhart has done some great work with his Model Glue Framework.</p><p>
</p><p>
The only real beef I have with I with Model Glue is that it is much slower than Fusebox 4. While it is not a 1.0 release yet, it has to reproduce an event model in the framework.</p><p>
</p><p>
On my development machine, which is a fairly modern Dell laptop with One gig of RAM, most requests take 500 to 1400 miliseconds to process.</p><p>
</p><p>
I have just started running the framework in the BlueDragon.NET server with much better results. My request times are only taking 40 to 70 miliseconds. This is more than adequate for production use.</p><p>
</p><p>
I highly suggest trying this framework on BlueDragon.NET. I am planning on testing some Mach-II and Fusebox 4 apps in the framework as well. </p>",2011-01-18 03:25:01.000,markdown

Quote Service not working on BlueDragon.NET,SOAP,"<p>I have a SOAP based web service that I wrote when ColdFusion MX 6 first came out, and it does not work in BlueDragon.NET.</p><p>
</p><p>
The web service is called a quote from Mr. Spock. (Yes, I am a GEEK.) It has a one method called getQuote which returns a coldFusion structure or a HashMap object if you are using Java. When I test my client for the web service in BlueDragon, it retuned an empty object. So I decided to rewrite my web service code to return a simple object instead. My current cfc for the web service looks like this;</p><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfset spock = structnew()&gt;</FONT><br></p><p>

<br></p><p>
<FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
ColdFusion MX has a built in way to describe simple objects in the WSDL file. If you create another cfc using the cfproperty tag, you can return that type in the web service.</p><p>
</p><p>
My structure has three name/value pairs for the quote, stardate and episode. The values are all of type string. So the following cfc that describes the simple object looks like this;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;cfcomponent displayname=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""SpockQuoteModel""</FONT>&gt;</FONT><br>

Playing with the Google Map API,Google-APIs,"<p>I have had a lot of fun playing around with some of the Google APIs lately. My favorite so far is the Google Map API. If you have seen the Google Maps <a href=""http://maps.google.com"" target=""_blank"">maps.google.com</a>. </p><p>
</p><p>
Google Maps uses an AJAX javascript object to display Interactive map within a div tag. AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. The Javascript object can call back to the Google server to pull updated information without having to reload the whole page. Google requires that the page use pure xhtml code and that you have a Google Map key. You can get a key by going to <a href=""http://www.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html"">this page</a> at Google. Place the following script call in the head section of your html page.</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;script src=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""<A TARGET=""_blank"" HREF=""http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&v=1&key=YOURKEYHERE"">http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&v=1&key=YOURKEYHERE</A>""</FONT> type=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""text/javascript""</FONT>&gt;</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR=NAVY><FONT COLOR=MAROON>&lt;/script&gt;</FONT></FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
Inside the body of the html page, place a div tag with the ID set to MAP. </p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code""><FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;div id=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""map""</FONT> style=<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""width: 900px; height: 600px""</FONT>&gt;</FONT><FONT COLOR=NAVY>&lt;/div&gt;</FONT></div></p><p>
</p><p>
The next thing that needs to be done is to create a Javascript object based on the div tag.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">var map = new GMap(document.getElementById(<FONT COLOR=BLUE>""map""</FONT>));</div></p><p>
</p><p>
There are several different controls that can be placed on the map. For the control with the zoom slider, you will need the large control.</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">map.addControl(new GLargeMapControl());</div></p><p>
</p><p>
The map is centered using a what is called a gpoint and the zoom level. The code looks like this;</p><p>
</p><p>
<div class=""code"">map.centerAndZoom(new GPoint(-81.48125,<FONT COLOR=BLUE> 30</FONT>.30912),<FONT COLOR=BLUE> 2</FONT>);</div></p><p>
</p><p>
The Gpoint is based on Geocodes, which is a decimal version of Latitude and longitude.</p>",2011-01-18 03:25:02.000,markdown
BlueDragon.NET,BlueDragonNET,"<p>I have recently started evaluating BlueDragon.NET from <a href=""http://www.newatlanta.com"">New Atlanta</a>. I heard that MySpaces will be switching to BlueDragon.NET soon, and I was curious to see if I can leverage .NET and ADO.NET with my CFML code.</p><p>
</p><p>
My first impressions so far have been mixed. I have used the Java version of BlueDragon before, but this is my first attempt with the .NET version. Before you can install, please use this check list to make sure you have the following running on your development box;</p><p>
<ul></p><p>
<li>A PC with Windows 2000 or XP Pro</li></p><p>
<li>IIS installed and running</li></p><p>
<li>.NET installed, either 1.1 or 2.0</li></p><p>
<li>The ASP.NET configured to run with IIS</li></p><p>
<li>The J# language pack addon for .NET</li></p><p>
<li>The BlueDragon.NET installer</li></p><p>
</ul></p><p>
</p><p>
If you need to run Multiple versions of ColdFusion, then I would suggest reading Charlie Arehart has written an article in the CFDJ on how to run multiple versions of CF and BD on the same box. New Atlanta has a copy of the article on their <a href=""http://www.newatlanta.com/images/CFDJ_03_09_Blueprints.pdf"">website</a>.</p>",2011-01-18 03:25:02.000,markdown
My New  Blog,My-New-Blog,"<p>Ok, I know I had a blog before, but it was really lame. I do not plan on copying over any of my old posts. I do plan on starting to add lots of new content to this website.</p><p>
</p><p>
My primary focus of this blog is Web application development, with a focus on CFML and SOAP. I also plan on adding an articles section very soon as well. I will also be focusing more on other subjects like BlueDragon, ASP.net, AJAX, Flash MX, Java, Design Patterns as well as ColdFusion MX. I am also planning on adding a code section where people can download copies of applications I have written.</p><p>
</p><p>
This application was written by Raymond Camden. It is called BlogCFC. It will work with ColdFusion or BlueDragon. His blog and downloads can be found <a href=""http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/"">here</a>.</p>",2011-01-18 03:25:02.000,markdown
Fekke.com is now hosted on Orchard 1.0,fekke.com-is-now-hosted-on-orchard-1.0,"<p>I moved my site over to <a title=""Orchard"" href=""http://www.orchardproject.net"" target=""_blank"">Orchard</a> 1.0 today. If you are not familiar with Orchard, it is a new open source content management system based on ASP.NET MVC 3.0.</p>
<p>I used Nick Mayne's BlogML importer to bring over my old blog. I will have a post up soon on the <span class=""spell noline"">challenges</span> I had with my conversion.</p>
<p>Here is the writeup on The Orchard web site about their mission;</p>
<p class=""content"">Orchard is a <strong>free, open source, community-focused</strong> project aimed at delivering applications and reusable components on the ASP.NET platform.</p>
<p class=""content"">Orchard will create shared    components for building ASP.NET applications and extensions, and specific applications that leverage these    components to meet the needs of end-users, designers, developers, and Web professionals. Additionally, we seek to create    partnerships with existing application authors to help them achieve their goals. Orchard is delivered   as part of the <a href=""http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery.aspx"">ASP.NET Open Source Gallery</a> under the    <a href=""http://www.outercurve.org/"">Outercurve Foundation</a>. It is licensed under a    <a href=""http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"">New BSD license</a>, which is    approved by the OSI.</p>
<p class=""content"">The intended output of the Orchard project is three-fold:</p>
<ul class=""list"">
<li>Individual .NET-based applications that appeal to end-users, designers, developers, and Web professionals</li>
<li>A set of re-usable components that makes it easy to build such applications</li>
<li>A vibrant community to help define these applications and extensions</li>
</ul>
<p class=""content"">In the near term, the Orchard project is focused on delivering a .NET-based CMS application that will      allow users to rapidly create content-driven Websites, and an extensibility framework that will allow      developers and customizers to provide additional functionality through module extensions and themes.</p>",2011-01-19 10:33:40.000,markdown

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I moved my site to ASP.NET MVC 2.0 last year. I was disappointed that there was not a blogging software that was not written for the MVC framework. When I started doing research on MVC based blogging engines, there were not any that used a relational database as the content repository for the blog. There was one that was a work of progress, and that was Oxite. Oxite went on to become the Orchard Project.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Orchard is a content management system. It is based on ASP.NET MVC 3.0, and allows you to add your own modules as well. The requirements for my site were pretty simple. I needed to have individual pages such as &lsquo;About&rsquo; and &lsquo;Contact Us&rsquo;, but I also needed to be able to bring over my blog.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Here are my experiences with installing orchard cms with the Microsoft webmatrix tool. I decided to port my home site using the new orchard since it is based on ASP.NET MVC 3.0.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Setting up the dev site</p>

JQuery 1.5 Released,jquery-1.5-released,"<p><a title=""JQuery 1.5"" href=""http://jquery.com"" target=""_blank"">JQuery 1.5</a> was released yesterday. I have not had a chance to review all of the new features, but it looks like it has all of the performance improvements like in previous releases. One of the cool new features is the .sub() function. The new Sub function actually creates a copy of the JQuery object that can be modified.</p>
<pre class=""brush: JavaScript;"">  (function(){
    var sub$ = jQuery.sub();

    sub$.fn.myCustomMethod = function(){
      return 'just for me';
    };

    sub$(document).ready(function() {
      sub$('body').myCustomMethod() // 'just for me'
    });
  })();
  
  typeof jQuery('body').myCustomMethod // undefined
</pre>
<p>There also many improvements to the Ajax functions. Read up on it at <a title=""JQuery 1.5"" href=""http://jquery.com"" target=""_blank"">JQuery.com</a>.</p>",2011-02-01 16:53:01.000,markdown

<h2>Implementing M-V-VM (Model-View-View Model) for WPF</h2>
<p>Now you are writing WPF applications, and wondering &ndash; what is all this code in the code behind? Shouldn&rsquo;t we be doing something different? Our cousins working with ASP.NET MVC don&rsquo;t even have a code behind! The answer is YES &ndash; you should indeed be doing it differently. The M-V-VM pattern is the WPF adaptation of the Presentation Model pattern (first documented by Martin Fowler). I will show how the M-V-VM pattern is utilized for building SOLID WPF applications that are also testable.</p>

How I Got Started in ColdFusion,how-i-got-started-in-coldfusion,"<p>I was reading some of the ColdFusion blogs, and I saw that <a href=""http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day"" title=""Steve Bryant"" target=""_blank"">Steve Bryant</a> had suggested about&nbsp;writing&nbsp;a post on how developers got started in ColdFusion development. I decided to write a blog post on how I got started doing ColdFusion development, and how it changed my life for the better.</p>
<p>I after I finished college in 1992, I got a job working for a company called Impact Publishing. I was hired initially to typeset black copy in a program called Aldus Pagemaker. That job eventually led to me to running a pre-press department for that company. Part of that job was making sure all of the Apple Macintosh computers ran properly on the network, and writing AppleScripts for automation. I also was starting to do web design using HTML.</p>
<p>By the end of the 90's I had moved into the IT department. While working for the technology group I heard that the company was sending group of our web developers to a three day training class on how to use ColdFusion 4.5. I convinced my boss to let me tag along with the developers since it would only cost an extra $200.00. During the class I fell in love with the language because it was built with the web in mind. I did not realize at the time, but ColdFusion is a DSL (domain specific language). Since it was based on &lt;CFTags&gt;, similiar to HTML tags, the code mixed with the other tags in a very natural way.</p>
<pre class=""brush: coldfusion""><cfquery name=""myQuery"" datasource=""database"">SELECT username FROM tblusers WHERE clue &gt; 0</cfquery>
<cfoutput query=""myQuery"">#username#<br /></cfoutput>
</pre>
<p>I did ColdFusion development for nearly six years exclusively. As ColdFusion grew and improved with new versions, I grew and improved with the language. When ColdFusion MX/6 came out, I started using ColdFusion Components to do object oriented programming. Then when ColdFusion 7 was released, I started using the new gateway features for integration. ColdFusion led me into SQL Server development, which led me into .NET development, which led me into iOS development.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about the ColdFusion community is that they are pretty progressive about adopting good practices and new technologies. In a lot of ways they are more advanced than the &nbsp;ASP.NET community. A lot of the good practices and frameworks have been adopted in the ASP.NET community, such as the JQuery library and the ASP.NET MVC framework.</p>
<p>I really enjoy doing ASP.NET MVC development. It is about the closest experience I have had to doing ColdFusion development&nbsp;</p>",2011-11-09 13:59:40.000,markdown

How I Got Started in ColdFusion,how-i-got-started-in-coldfusion,"<p>I was reading some of the ColdFusion blogs, and I saw that <a href=""http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day"" title=""Steve Bryant"" target=""_blank"">Steve Bryant</a> had suggested about&nbsp;writing&nbsp;a post on how developers got started in ColdFusion development. I decided to write a blog post on how I got started doing ColdFusion development, and how it changed my life for the better.</p>
<p>I after I finished college in 1992, I got a job working for a company called Impact Publishing. I was hired initially to typeset black copy in a program called Aldus Pagemaker. That job eventually led to me to running a pre-press department for that company. Part of that job was making sure all of the Apple Macintosh computers ran properly on the network, and writing AppleScripts for automation. I also was starting to do web design using HTML.</p>
<p>By the end of the 90's I had moved into the IT department. While working for the technology group I heard that the company was sending group of our web developers to a three day training class on how to use ColdFusion 4.5. I convinced my boss to let me tag along with the developers since it would only cost an extra $200.00. During the class I fell in love with the language because it was built with the web in mind. I did not realize at the time, but ColdFusion is a DSL (domain specific language). Since it was based on &lt;CFTags&gt;, similiar to HTML tags, the code mixed with the other tags in a very natural way.</p>
<pre class=""brush: coldfusion""><cfquery name=""myQuery"" datasource=""database"">SELECT username FROM tblusers WHERE clue &gt; 0</cfquery>
<cfoutput query=""myQuery"">#username#<br /></cfoutput>
</pre>
<p>I did ColdFusion development for nearly six years exclusively. As ColdFusion grew and improved with new versions, I grew and improved with the language. When ColdFusion MX/6 came out, I started using ColdFusion Components to do object oriented programming. Then when ColdFusion 7 was released, I started using the new gateway features for integration. ColdFusion led me into SQL Server development, which led me into .NET development, which led me into iOS development.</p>

Some of the big improvements are a new shared tier hosting, A-Record support and Fast-CGI support.</p>
<p>One of the features I like is GitHub and CodePlex continuous integration support. He has some demonstrations on how you can push changes into your repository and they automatically get loaded onto the website.</p>
<p>I have avoided using Azure in the past because of price and a-record support, but now with the new pricing structure I will probably use Azure going forward for small sites.</p>
<p>Azure also supports PHP and Node.js applications. They even host Linux VMs if you need a Linux VM.</p>",2012-09-20 17:42:19.000,markdown
Objective-C for C# Developers at Jax Code Camp on October 6th,objective-c-for-csharp-developers-at-jaxcodecamp,"<p>I am going to be doing a presentation on developing for iOS devices at the <a href=""http://www.jaxdug.net/codecamp/home"" title=""Jax Code Camp"" target=""_blank"">Jacksonville Code Camp</a> on October 6th. The schedule has not been posted yet on the web site, but I just got notification that my presentation was selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation will be similiar to one I did in 2009. Objective-C is the primary language used for developing apps on the iOS and the Mac. There have been a lot of changes to the iOS SDK since I did that last presentation in 2009.</p>
<p>The point of the presentation will be to familiarize Objective-C to C# and Java developers. There are a lot of similarities between C# and Objective-C. I will explore these so that C# or Java developer can walk away with better understanding using their existing knowledge.</p>
<p>I hope we get a good turn out for the JaxCodeCamp this year. Please tell your developer friends to come out a week from Saturday.</p>",2012-09-26 16:05:16.000,markdown

This is an app I wrote and published in the Apple App store. I will show the code that comprises the business logic, which is C# but is compiled on a Mac using MonoTouch. This process converts it to Objective-C. I will also demonstrate Apple's Xcode and Interface Builder and how they interact with MonoTouch. I will talk about some of the steps necessary to get your apps into the app store.&nbsp;<br /><br />BIO:&nbsp;<br /><br />Irv Adams holds a BA degree in Mathematics. He has twenty-seven years in the IT field, ten as a self-employed consultant and the rest as a client support and internal systems specialist.

"TypeScript Presentation on February 26 at the JaxArcSig ",typescript-presentation-on-february-26-at-the-jaxarcsig,"<p>I am going to be doing the presentation this month at the <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/JaxArcSIG/events/100991602/"" title=""JaxArcSig"" target=""_blank"">JaxArcSig</a>. The topic will be on <a href=""http://www.typescriptlang.org/"" title=""TypeScript"" target=""_blank"">TypeScript</a>, which is a language based on Javascript. TypeScript essentially adds a type system to Javascript. It also allows developers create classes and modules in Javascript.</p>
<p>The language is being developed at Microsoft. Anders Hejlsberg is the primary designer. They have added a project type in Visual Studio 2012 where you can write TypeScript, and VS will compile TypeScript down into Javascript. You can also use the Node Package Manager in Node JS to download the compiler. The compiler is written in TypeScript.</p>
<p>The meeting will start at 6:00 PM at Building 500 at the Bank of America campus on February 26th. Here is a map to the location.</p>
